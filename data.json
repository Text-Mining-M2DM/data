{"abstract": "A Terrestrial LiDAR system or Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) was used to detect changes in burnt landscapes. Since wildfires are a common occurrence in the Australian landscape, prescribed burns are routinely carried out by land management agencies and government departments. These prescribed burns reduce the fuel load which decreases the severity of subsequent unplanned wildfires. Recent advances in LiDAR have enabled the successful measurement of complex structures in the field with both high accuracy and precision. LiDAR remote sensing has been used for estimating a wide variety of forest metrics. However, airborne LiDAR in particular has been unsuited for measuring understorey vegetation. Modern ground-based LiDAR systems can overcome some of the shortcomings of airborne LiDAR systems (sub-centimetre resolution, canopy obscuration). In this study, four plots of 10m radius were chosen within a prescribed burn area in St. Andrews, Victoria which took place in April 2012. One plot was unburnt (control) while the other three plots were given different fire treatments to simulate different fire severities. The TLS was operated from the centre of the plot and data was collected at a resolution of 10mm at a radius of 10m. Laser scans were captured pre-burn, and post-burn in week two. Data analysis was carried out at different scales (voxel and plot) and at the vertical strata comprising near-surface and surface fuel layer within 1m from the ground. Within voxels, metrics used to compute change were changes in point density and maximum z value. At the plot scale, change in volume was computed.", "authors": ["Vaibhav Gupta", "Karin Reinke", "Simon D.

{"abstract": "Reliable, cost-efficient, and fast medical diagnosis, especially in crucial cases, is still a big challenge in today's world. This paper presents a holonic medical diagnosis system that combines the advantages of holonic systems and multi-agent systems in order to implement a highly efficient and robust Internet-based diagnosis system for diseases. The proposed holonic medical diagnosis system consists of a tree-like structured alliance of medical experts - realized by agents - that collaborate in order to provide a viable medical diagnosis. Each agent has a certain responsibility. Agents at higher levels of the holarchy represent experts in a broader field of diseases while the leaves are experts in one specific disease. The goal-based decision-making process is based on a hybrid, i.e., reactive and deliberative architecture. Reactive behavior is needed to compare the information provided to the agent with its pattern base in which possible appearances of the disease are stored in form of patterns. Deliberative behavior is needed in order to interpret and put in context the original data and information provided to the agent and to analyze and evaluate the results of the pattern matching process.", "authors": ["Rainer Unland"], "n_citation": 16, "references": ["02ec4720-4eb4-47af-b9b5-b72ee9827051", "85c23a4b-55fa-4263-8eda-6272e9cc940d", "bbab4d2a-0a9c-4721-9a13-038a6f54586b", "eac0c268-756d-49ca-a7be-73a65ed16f55", "f2bcf168-865a-4a8b-b80f-66bf3ba07854"], "title": "A holonic multi-agent system for robust, flexible, and reliable medical diagnosis", "venue": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science", "year": 2003, "id": "6302f292-621c-466a-9a92-01df3d6b2097"}

{"abstract": "We study the problem of covering a two-dimensional spatial region  P  , cluttered with occluders, by sensors. A sensor placed at a location  p   covers  a point  x  in  P  if  x  lies within sensing radius  r  from  p  and  x  is visible from  p  , i.e., the segment  px  does not intersect any occluder. The goal is to compute a placement of the minimum number of sensors that cover  P  . We propose a  landmark-based  approach for covering  P  . Suppose  P  has  ***  holes, and it can be covered by  h  sensors. Given a small parameter  ***  > 0, let  ***  : =  ***  ( h  , ***  ) = ( h  / ***  )(1 + ln (1 +  ***  )). We prove that one can compute a set  L  of  O  ( ***  log ***  log(1/ ***  ))  landmarks  so that if a set  S  of sensors covers  L  , then  S  covers at least (1 ***  ***  )-fraction of  P  . It is surprising that so few landmarks are needed, and that the number of landmarks depends only on  h  , and does not directly depend on the number of vertices in  P  . We then present efficient randomized algorithms, based on the greedy approach, that, with high probability, compute $O(\\tilde{h}\\log \\lambda)$ sensor locations to cover  L  ; here $\\tilde{h} \\le h$ is the number sensors needed to cover  L  . We propose various extensions of our approach, including: (i) a weight function over  P  is given and  S  should cover at least (1 ***  ***  ) of the weighted area of  P  , and (ii) each point of  P  is covered by at least  t  sensors, for a given parameter  t  *** 1.", "authors": ["Pankaj K.

{"abstract": "A poorly designed web browser extension with a security vulnerability may expose the whole system to an attacker. Therefore, attacks directed at \"benign-but-buggy\" extensions, as well as extensions that have been written with malicious intents pose significant security threats to a system running such components. Recent studies have indeed shown that many Firefox extensions are over-privileged, making them attractive attack targets. Unfortunately, users currently do not have many options when it comes to protecting themselves from extensions that may potentially be malicious. Once installed and executed, the extension needs to be trusted. This paper introduces Sentinel, a policy enforcer for the Firefox browser that gives fine-grained control to the user over the actions of existing JavaScript Firefox extensions. The user is able to define policies (or use predefined ones) and block common attacks such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, saved password theft, and preference modification. Our evaluation of Sentinel shows that our prototype implementation can effectively prevent concrete, real-world Firefox extension attacks without a detrimental impact on users' browsing experience.", "authors": ["Kaan Onarlioglu", "Mustafa Battal", "William K.

{"abstract": "Research has proven the usefulness of serious gaming for learning and advancing motivation by a combination of visuals, audio, text, and entertaining elements. Nevertheless, a broadly accepted, practical instructional design approach to serious games does not yet exist, especially when focusing on vocational edu-cation. The authors introduce a new instructional design model developed for this massive field of education, and argue some advantages compared to other design approaches.

{"abstract": "Participatory design (PD) and its derivative distributed participatory design (DPD) are examples of collaborative research methods that have been successfully applied to information systems problems. Yet, there are other collaborative research methods such as action research and design science that have also been used in the same context. This paper argues that this trifurcation in collaborative methods is unhelpful and that the \u2018walled gardens\u2019 in which these methods exist inhibit learning and the methods\u2019 development. As PD moves to tackle the problems that arise in distributed projects, it becomes more necessary to look outside its own domain for solutions. This paper investigates whether collaborative research projects that are categorized under one method also match the characteristics of the other methods. It finds that research projects using different methods demonstrate remarkable similarities concerning research contributions, roots, and methodological guidelines, but use different terminologies, and also maintain method-specific publication outlets and communities. Thus, insight into some of the issues raised by participatory design in distributed contexts may arise if PD looks outside its walled garden.", "authors": ["Claudia Loebbecke", "Philip Powell"], "n_citation": 3, "references": ["108c1a67-044e-4d36-893c-e0d546077a1f", "361ed73b-baea-4a71-85da-7cdeaada63a7", "3f772750-3780-4bbd-a687-2bcd0a6e7707", "4ac9ab99-6756-4c58-9850-b662a5d68fcd", "53fab6e6-b3b6-40dc-8290-0df6d96ad7e0", "5d7a48c5-605f-45df-856c-7053120194fc", "5e07ce6b-9732-443a-b3bf-f37bbee3865a", "5e3aaf01-7604-4878-9d4a-531ea040f29e", "64a8a402-d60f-47d9-8baa-3dd6c3dce68d", "6d05e6fe-a3af-4e09-a8c4-8789f6e24c73", "6f793a28-8968-4d29-a5bf-8c5a0fbd302e", "80698658-ee39-4df4-bd1a-a09150149d00", "85b25711-f75c-4df0-9f1a-c4b17acfa9e1", "885cfaf9-43e5-4101-9554-40962d09fe53", "8df67660-3b31-451f-9398-ac8010b0d3ef", "96f3acc6-e630-4a55-9385-b747a9dccee6", "99de8f49-70f8-431d-a60f-feed25d2168b", "9e46de39-1e70-4d0c-a1d7-8a0260061c97", "a24a5ae1-2d57-4519-8b85-660a36c259e6", "afd63c47-1b9b-4ca0-8693-e8f3efd61b64", "ba76c3e1-dbba-479f-8b50-e27299668d51", "ba87dae8-c14e-46e4-b313-8a93d6e12eee", "c7dd6f19-f9a3-4dd8-9b6a-b9bc63f9e2a1", "ca5d3ade-1f44-42e8-8b99-158a723b00a8", "d10d8050-d416-45bc-90e9-f06f399e9d23", "d1948e40-c844-4384-9cf0-4d193433c1d0", "d1e3513e-ba29-4d83-bff4-bb256da0c23e", "d252bac2-4fbc-49a5-b6bd-0dc91d7b28d9", "d3fcf830-70bc-4237-b4d8-99afb7f57f90", "d96d173a-107c-4a52-9f25-24f747f4cf96", "e2386822-a40c-4c16-a29e-a59242aab27a", "e5767879-f411-46ae-9e47-be1dc2b893ec", "f380718b-5dc3-4ae3-86a9-55bf591ea353", "f57faa0d-f8c3-4118-81c8-fabf1920040e", "fb861a3e-6d22-44cb-a80e-c5a2e0c806d8", "fd12395f-6901-47b2-bded-0773197bf476", "fe2918f3-a823-44cc-ae45-5ae902336497"], "title": "Furthering Distributed Participative Design", "venue": "Scandinavian Journal of Information Systems", "year": 2009, "id": "64545d16-b3e7-4ea3-8db3-326ed600ac8a"}

Understanding transposon insertion-site preferences is critically important in functional genomics and gene therapy studies.

{"abstract": "Motivational attitudes play an important role in investigations into intelligent agents. One of the key problems of representing and reasoning about motivational attitudes is which propositions are the desirable ones. The answer based on classical logic is that the propositions that logically imply the goal are desirable and the others are not. We argue that this criterion is inadequate for the incomplete knowledge about environments for an agent. In this paper, we present a simple and intuitive semantics---partial implication---for the characterization of desirable propositions. In this semantics, Proposition P is a desirable one with respect to a given goal Q if and only if P is \u201cuseful\u201d and \u201charmless\u201d to Q in any situation. Partial implication is an extension of classical implication.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we explore the capabilities of a recently proposed method for non-linear dimensionality reduction and visualization called Locally Linear Embedding (LLE). LLE is proposed as an alternative to the traditional approaches. Its ability to deal with large sizes of high dimensional data and non-iterative way to find the embeddings make it more and more attractive to several researchers. All the studies which investigated and experimented this approach have concluded that LLE is a robust and efficient algorithm when the data lie on a smooth and well-sampled single manifold. None explored the behavior of the algorithm when the data include some noise (or outliers). Here, we show theoretically and empirically that LLE is significantly sensitive to the presence of a few outliers. Then we propose a robust extension to tackle this problem. Further, we investigate the behavior of the LLE algorithm in cases of disjoint manifolds, demonstrate the lack of single global coordinate system and discuss some alternatives.", "authors": ["Abdenour Hadid", "Matti Pietik\u00e4inen"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0efb7bac-1ce1-4b9a-bcfd-004619e6c640", "2834deb1-eaf2-40c8-899c-fdf2d28e556f", "28610fc3-2cc2-4acd-84ba-0e456fe584eb", "5534521e-21b4-43a9-b473-4af104582267", "5b3d3509-f648-4bb2-a026-60aa65e6b94b", "8fcc20b2-42d3-4524-ab51-726deb9fd907", "9270a9b5-940a-4394-814f-433c6440f286", "d6e78be6-6ad4-4ea2-8076-911d015644e3"], "title": "Efficient Locally Linear Embeddings of Imperfect Manifolds", "venue": "machine learning and data mining in pattern recognition", "year": 2003, "id": "64f2d9af-d854-4dd5-b1db-0164b81d629e"}

{"abstract": "The present paper proposes a new method that synthesizes answer evaluation rules using layered neural networks. A Base Question Answering System that employs a combined conventional method (NUT-BASE system) is implemented and evaluated in the NTCIR-5 workshop Question Answering Challenge 3 (QAC3). Based on the evaluation results, the authors focus on performance improvement for the list task and propose a new method using a neural-network-based machine learning technique for synthesizing answer candidate evaluation measures. There are several measures by which to evaluate the likelihood of the answer candidate, so the system must synthesize these measures in order to determine the answer set. However, the rule for synthesizing the measures in the NUT-BASE system was not effective because it was based on an empirical intuition. Therefore, a performance improvement is expected by the proposed method because it is based on quantitative reason. The experimental evaluation showed that the proposed method achieves a performance improvement, with a value of 0.01 for the mean F-measure.", "authors": ["Yasuharu Matsuda", "Takashi Yukawa"], "n_citation": 1, "references": ["1a0bb7cc-6953-420d-9017-d6ea45c559a0", "39552fa0-5b58-4015-b549-cd7fbaa4af1e"], "title": "Synthesis of Multiple Answer Evaluation Measures using a Machine Learning Technique for a QA System", "venue": "", "year": 2005, "id": "651d9488-1fe6-4efe-91fd-5ddbcf5db105"}
{"abstract": "The alarms generated by mechanical ventilators when patients become disconnected can blend in with other typical sounds of the intensive care unit. Ventilator alarms that go unnoticed for extended periods of time often result in permanent patient harm or death. We developed a unit-wide system to monitor ventilator disconnection alarms. When a disconnection is identified, the system takes control of every computer in the patient\u2019s intensive care unit and generates an enhanced audio and visual alert. This system was tested in four ICUs at LDS Hospital. Acceptance by medical personnel was very high and patient safety was improved through early intervention that avoided prolonged hypoxia.

Our approach is flexible, and our system can optionally use known landmarks in the target dataset to constrain the localization. Our novel pipeline is built upon variants of state-of-the-art facial landmark localization methods. Specifically, we propose to label images in the target dataset jointly rather than inde- pendently and exploit exemplars from both the source datasets and the target dataset.

{"abstract": "Mobile commerce (m-commerce) is currently more widely adapted in developed countries than the developing countries. Developing countries lag behind due to inappropriate technological infrastructure for the provisioning of m-commerce services. Though there exist various obstacles of adapting m- commerce services in developing countries, this paper addresses the perfor- mance and reliability issues. In particular, it considers the limited bandwidth of wireless networks and the capacity of underlying web servers involved in processing m-commerce requests. If m-commerce requests are not processed efficiently then they are more likely to be dropped wherever the network connection can be intermittent as in developing countries. This paper proposes an approach which is based on the class-based priority scheme that distinguish- es m-commerce requests from other requests. The idea is to give high priority to the requests coming from mobile devices (over wireless networks) as compared to requests coming from standard PC/laptops (over standard Internet (wired) connections) as the later can tolerate longer delay and are less susceptible to connection failures. The proposed approach is formally specified and is imple- mented as a prototype tool.

It is said that the structure of music is somewhat similar to that of natural language sentences. When we try to write rules for chord progression in context-free grammar, we need to add a lot of rules for trivial exceptions. However in HPSG, we can encapsulate such diversity in the feature structure of each category and can reduce the number of rules. In addition, we can utilize the notion of head, which is the prime constituent in lower concepts, to represent various hierarchical knowledge in musicology. We show that our system adequately resolves the mutual dependency between the key and the chord progression from a given sequences of chords, and that the system outputs the candidates of plausible harmony sequences.

{"abstract": "The Rule Interchange Format (RIF) is an emerging W3C format that allows rules to be exchanged between rule systems. Uncertainty is an intrinsic feature of real world knowledge, hence it is important to take it into account when building logic rule formalisms. However, the set of truth values in the Basic Logic Dialect (RIF-BLD) currently consists of only two values (t and f). In this paper, we first present two techniques of encoding uncertain knowledge and its fuzzy semantics in RIF-BLD presentation syntax. We then propose an extension leading to an Uncertainty Rule Dialect (RIF-URD) to support a direct representation of uncertain knowledge. In addition, rules in Logic Programs (LP) are often used in combination with the other widely-used knowledge representation formalism of the Semantic Web, namely Description Logics (DL), in order to provide greater expressive power. To prepare DL as well as LP extensions, we present a fuzzy extension to Description Logic Programs (DLP), called Fuzzy DLP, and discuss its mapping to RIF. Such a formalism not only combines DL with LP, as in DLP, but also supports uncertain knowledge representation.", "authors": ["Jidi Zhao", "Harold Boley"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["03073e9a-0894-4180-ad77-d2312da05e10", "166cb1ca-ab45-4efb-9bae-240604e14193", "1ea281bd-9df4-49b9-9865-4ef348482a8b", "292b10d3-9fe7-4ff0-a7f1-03abe0a55fd5", "48e7e71e-5a93-4bc9-ab58-98bd8c57efbe", "5bb6cdad-da62-41f1-a321-d3ddbb5717e7", "82f1fba5-f3eb-4498-be11-5399117ca2c7", "941b33d4-53aa-446d-9692-6d88212603c8", "952a4b78-1ed8-4c7f-805d-9f131f107eaa", "96f7ca73-d78e-4450-9ff6-c461f8e2475e", "9d01958c-f261-4534-8e05-c7604a4bd595", "b2982135-22ca-4fb9-a360-827c95828295", "c8b99493-a3b0-4257-b7cd-0c0a73251f14", "cf45d385-8216-4a4c-8ab0-3c8341acaf64", "ef44e417-a1f4-4d4c-92ad-5befd051d351"], "title": "Uncertainty treatment in the rule interchange format: from encoding to extension", "venue": "", "year": 2008, "id": "68016f4a-8335-4383-ab86-7eeea14b8518"}

{"abstract": "In this paper, a new method to represent human ear for biometrics purposes is introduced. Even if ear has a uniform distribution of color, human external ear characteristics are considered unique to each individual and perma- nent during the lifetime of an adult. For these reasons ear biometrics approaches are relying on morphological ear properties. Even if ear biometrics is a young topic a variety of approaches have been proposed to characterize the ear geome- try and topology.

{"abstract": "This article describes a new approach for cues discrimination between speakers addressed to a speaker identification task. To this end, we make use of elements of decision theory. We propose to decompose the conventional feature space (MFCCs) into two subspaces which carry information about discriminative and confusable sections of the speech signal. The method is based on the idea that, instead of adapting the speakers models to a new test environment, we require the test utterance to fit the speakers models environment. Discriminative sections of training speech are used to estimate the probability density function (pdf) of a discriminative world model (DM), and confusable sections to estimate the probability density function of a confusion world model (CM). The two models are then used as a maximum likelihood detector (filter) at the input of the recogniser. The method was experimented on highly mismatched telephone speech and achieves a considerable improvement (averaging 16 % gain in performance) over the baseline GMM system.", "authors": ["Mohamed Mihoubi", "Gilles Boulianne", "Pierre Dumouchel"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["6527b6cf-f42b-449d-9ad6-cafe1be90e3b", "86d9a5c1-4e89-49d7-bd63-529df233971e", "ce584fb2-1340-4ed4-ae14-8de79f03d361", "ea9215da-5e81-440a-a49a-540a4ab8e318"], "title": "DISCRIMINATIVE TRAINING AND MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD DETECTOR FOR SPEAKER IDENTIFICATION", "venue": "conference of the international speech communication association", "year": 2003, "id": "6881954c-178d-4745-a87c-8cd16989cd14"}

Some of the diagrams we elicit from students represent image processing algorithms, and others represent predictions of what particular mathematical formulas will do to images. In order to serve its educational assessment and research purposes, INFACT-SKETCH provides an unusual combination of features: tight integration with a web-based textual communication system called INFACT-FORUM, administrative control of which drawing tools students will be permitted to use (freehand, rectangles, ovals, text labels, lines, etc.), complete event capture for timed playback of the drawing process for any sketch in the system, graphical quoting option in message replies, and structured annotations for educational assessment.

{"abstract": "Information technology (IT) radically alters the cost of capturing, storing, and analyzing information, and thus dramatically alters the value of the historical data represented by a firm's detailed transaction records of customer interactions. Yet, information systems are seldom used to their full potential in developing flexible pricing strategies and tailored offerings for individual customers, based either on the actual cost of serving these customers or on their demonstrated preferences and requirements. This will become increasingly crucial in industries with heterogeneous customers and with costs that vary widely across customers, in order to enable flexible pricing and to provide services that are accurately targeted at the needs of specific customer segments. In addition, accurate, detailed, and robust cost-accounting systems and expertise in the interpretation of performance data will increasingly become essential for competing successfully; those firms prevented from accurate microsegmentation by corporate culture and tradition, by regulation, or by an outmoded information infrastructure will be vulnerable to newer and more nimble competitors. In particular, being the low-cost provider with economies of scale will not provide adequate defense against targeted cream-skimming by opportunistic competitors, able to offer lower prices to selected customer segments. The earliest academic papers on the strategic implications of information technology explicitly adopted a framework recommending that firms adopt a single, simple generic strategy from a small set (cost leadership, differentiation, or niche). In contrast, recent experience suggests that IT may enable firms to select from more finely tuned strategic options, and that it may require them to implement multiple strategies simultaneously.", "authors": ["Eric K.

{"abstract": "The general trend towards complex technical systems with embedded software results in an increasing demand for dependable high quality software. The UML as an advanced object-oriented technology provides in principle the essential concepts which are required to handle the increasing complexity of these safety-critical software systems. However, the current and forthcoming UML versions do not directly apply to the outlined problem. Available hazard analysis techniques on the other hand do not provide the required degree of integration with software design notations. To narrow the gap between safety-critical system development and UML techniques, the presented approach supports the compositional hazard analysis of UML models described by restricted component and deployment diagrams. The approach permits to systematically identify which hazards and failures are most serious, which components or set of components require a more detailed safety analysis, and which restrictions to the failure propagation are assumed in the UML design.", "authors": ["Holger Giese", "Matthias Tichy", "Daniela Schilling"], "n_citation": 61, "references": ["021cbeb3-bd5e-4b49-bb6f-e2bf2e9495c2", "5c8182b0-1e1d-42f3-a39d-cac39928a6ab", "81541435-ee9c-4e08-a47c-76e93e1697d0", "c3ff4534-839c-4c13-886d-b0c296566716", "eff9adf0-c70b-42cc-9d6d-47ec62958c23", "f98f00f9-0763-4066-918c-c31ab6487419"], "title": "Compositional hazard analysis of UML component and deployment models", "venue": "international conference on computer safety, reliability, and security", "year": 2004, "id": "68c6b323-cdfd-4aac-81fe-ecc7a65a4688"}

{"abstract": "The basic characteristic of fuzzy language is the meaning uncertainty and fuzziness of the language units, such as words and sentences, and how to represent such fuzzy meaning formally is a problem that is worth studying. This paper attempts to analyze and explore the formal meaning representation of Chinese fuzzy words. The fuzzy language reflects the ambiguity of human thinking and understanding, which is objective and inevitable. Marx once said: A thing is itself and changing continuously, which has a contradiction of invariability and variability (1). Therefore, all materials in the world are in the unceasing and absolute movement, while stillness is a certain period of development and is relatively temporary. So, people mostly take the continuous movement as a background when they distinguish the properties of things and use a limited discrete model to characterize a continuous process of infinite development (2). This will inevitably lead to ambiguity in people's understanding of the properties of things, which has reflection in fuzzy language, such as fuzzy words and sentences. This paper mainly discusses the fuzzy words in Chinese. Currently, semantic problem is the bottleneck of language information processing. The fundamental precondition of solving this problem is a symbolic and formal representation of the meaning of various elements in language systems. So that the computer can more accurately understand and process natural languages. The fundamental property of the fuzzy language is the semantic ambiguity.

{"abstract": "We introduce fast and scalable algorithms that implement bounded- and unbounded-size lock-free k-FIFO queues on parallel, shared memory hardware. Logically, a k-FIFO queue can be understood as queue where elements may be dequeued out-of-order up to k-1, or as pool where the oldest element is dequeued within at most k dequeue operations. The presented algorithms enable up to k enqueue and k dequeue operations to be performed in parallel. Unlike previous designs, however, the algorithms also implement linearizable emptiness and full checks without impairing scalability. We show experimentally that there exist optimal and robust k that result in best access performance and scalability. We then demonstrate that our algorithms outperform and outscale all state-of-the-art concurrent pool and queue algorithms that we considered in all micro- and most macrobenchmarks. Moreover, we demonstrate a prototypical controller which identifies optimal k automatically at runtime achieving better performance than with any statically configuredi\u00be?k.", "authors": ["Christoph M.

{"abstract": "In an attempt to improve models of human perception, the recognition of phonemes in nonsense utterances was predicted with automatic speech recognition (ASR) in order to analyze its applicability for modeling human speech recognition (HSR) in noise. In the first experiments, several feature types are used as input for an ASR system; the resulting phoneme scores are compared to listening experiments using the same speech data. With conventional training, the highest correlation between predicted and measured recognition was observed for perceptual linear prediction features (r = 0:84). Secondly, a new training paradigm for ASR is proposed with the aim of improving the prediction of phoneme intelligibility. For this perceptual training, the original utterance labels are modified based on the confusions measured in HSR tests. The modified ASR training improved the overall prediction, with the best models (r = 0:89) exceeding those obtained with conventional training (r = 0:80).

{"abstract": "We present an efficient Lagrangian framework for simulating granular material with high visual detail. Our model solves the computationally and numerically critical forces on a coarsely sampled particle simulation. Pressure and friction forces are expressed as constraint forces which are iteratively computed. We realize stable and realistic interactions with rigid bodies by employing pressure and friction-based boundary forces. Stable formations of sand piles are realized by employing the concept of rigid-body sleeping. Furthermore, material transitions from dry to wet can be modeled. Visual realism is achieved by coupling a set of highly resolved particles with the base simulation at low computational costs. Thereby, detail is added which is not resolved by the base simulation. The practicability of the approach is demonstrated by showing various high-resolution simulations with up to 20 million particles.", "authors": ["Markus Ihmsen", "Arthur Wahl", "Matthias Teschner"], "n_citation": 6, "references": ["1d325fcd-626e-48b1-a07c-3003f3bb4d2f", "22fa1c69-9674-4a77-8cb7-e078d45dbd56", "467d36e9-b88a-4153-b32b-46379f2a0756", "564f509d-3ec4-481e-b97f-6909ca13371a", "59f2ebb6-e83c-405e-82b5-c060db7e780a", "5dd30e40-62fd-4fd4-9968-2f7297aee941", "66222d9f-9ec5-4bc6-b954-1cc37727e951", "8958c4ce-4122-486c-b528-aea777c88fe9", "8a34be78-0698-4060-9988-b309bd954019", "9901e6e0-b8a6-465a-89e6-00917ae50f47", "9f454444-5c66-4a55-9959-7df5e60380a9", "a09a0ae1-1ba0-4e27-a73c-ce224353f623", "a6c76788-4ab0-4271-b6d9-61ab6f3923cb", "ac544bc2-f9d8-4e10-b856-70c105e2b08b", "aebb4858-c61d-4850-b4f4-a073ab75cbd2", "afb235f4-8c84-47ec-921f-d90ee7755465", "bd7846fd-eab7-4ce7-96e4-b31e1c484030", "c8928eaf-2193-4d2d-9189-60a0c9f92c7c", "ccc90e57-2254-411a-8a31-e31e9e8ab019", "cee0af83-0e86-4f28-889a-5dc35ecd5ea6", "e2e34f6f-2b40-4b7f-a76d-72bf09ff0cd1", "f67e15c4-7fb2-4ade-a8c8-feb4ac391585"], "title": "Technical Section: A Lagrangian framework for simulating granular material with high detail", "venue": "Computers & Graphics", "year": 2013, "id": "6a5df590-c49e-4dbe-9df0-4da25eda6bdf"}
{"abstract": "Muscle-based models of the human face produce high quality animation but rely on recorded muscle activity signals or synthetic muscle signals often derived by trial and error. In this paper we present a dynamic inversion of a muscle-based model [1] that permits the animation to be created from kinematic recordings of facial movements. Using a nonlinear optimizer (Powell\u2019s algorithm) the inversion produces a muscle activity set for 16 muscle groups in the lower face that minimize the root mean square error between kinematic data recorded with OPTOTRAK and the corresponding nodes of the modeled facial mesh. This inverted muscle activity is then used to animate the facial model. The results of a first experiment showed that the inversion-synthesis method can accurately reproduce a synthetic facial animation, even for a partial sampling of the face. The results of a second experiment showed that the method is as successful for OPTOTRAK recording of a talker uttering a sentence. The animation was of high quality.", "authors": ["Michel Pitermann", "Kevin G.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel automated tongue segmentation scheme which can well address the edge enhancement and the initialization problem of the tongue body contour. First, according to the grey level distribution of the contour, we propose a 2D Gabor magnitude - based detector for the enhancement of the contour of tongue body. Second, to cope with the discontinuity of edge detection results, we select two stable segments of the tongue body contours and use the fast marching method to obtain the closed tongue body contour. Moreover, gradient vector flow (GVF) snake is used to obtain the final segmentation result and an augmented Lagrangian method is adopted for fast computation of GVF field.

{"abstract": "Situated agents which use learning real-time search are well poised to address challenges of real-time path-finding in robotic and computer game applications. They interleave a local lookahead search with movement execution, explore an initially unknown map, and converge to better paths over repeated experiences. In this paper, we first investigate how three known extensions of the most popular learning real-time search algorithm (LRTA*) influence its performance in a path-finding domain. Then, we combine automatic state abstraction with learning real-time search. Our scheme of dynamically building a state abstraction allows us to generalize updates to the heuristic function, thereby speeding up learning. The novel algorithm converges up to 80 times faster than LRTA* with only one fifth of the response time of A*.", "authors": ["Vadim Bulitko", "Nathan R.

{"abstract": "While active flow control is an established method for controlling flow separation on vehicles and airfoils, the design of the actuation is often done by trial and error.

{"abstract": "Although the evaluation of knowledge in the form of a quantitation of scientific output is not uncontroversial, it is a widely practised form of science evaluation. For more than 30 years, the Science Citation Index (SCI) has been alone in fulfilling this purpose. But since 2005 Scopus is a direct competitor to the SCI-databases. Comparing the two databases should help to answer questions that could have repercussions for the future generation of bibliometric analyses. The results of the comparison will allow us to more reliably rate Scopus, as a new data source, against the established SCI. In future, people who generate bibliometric analyses must be able to justify why they chose to use one database and not the other. It will not be enough to simply claim that SCI is the established source.", "authors": ["Rafael Ball", "Dirk Tunger"], "n_citation": 63, "references": [], "title": "Science Indicators Revisited - Science Citation Index versus SCOPUS: A Bibliometric Comparison of Both Citation Databases", "venue": "", "year": 2006, "id": "6ce6ba63-2cd7-4103-a2da-11a11988cbd8"}

{"abstract": "Gradient-boosted regression trees (GBRTs) have proven to be an effective solution to the learning-to-rank problem. This work proposes and evaluates techniques for training GBRTs that have efficient runtime characteristics. Our approach is based on the simple idea that compact, shallow, and balanced trees yield faster predictions: thus, it makes sense to incorporate some notion of execution cost during training to \"encourage\" trees with these topological characteristics. We propose two strategies for accomplishing this: the first, by directly modifying the node splitting criterion during tree induction, and the second, by stagewise tree pruning. Experiments on a standard learning-to-rank dataset show that the pruning approach is superior; one balanced setting yields an approximately 40% decrease in prediction latency with minimal reduction in output quality as measured by NDCG.", "authors": ["Nima Asadi 0001", "Jimmy J.

{"abstract": "Borrowed context graph transformation is a simple and powerful technique developed by Ehrig and Konig that allows us to derive labeled transitions and bisimulation congruences for graph transformation systems or, in general, for process calculi that can be defined in terms of graph transformation systems. Moreover, the same authors have also shown how to use this technique for the verification of bisimilarity. In principle, the main results about borrowed context transformation do not apply only to plain graphs, but they are generic in the sense that they apply to all categories that satisfy certain properties related to the notion of adhesivity. In particular, this is the case of attributed graphs. However, as we show in the paper, the techniques used for checking bisimilarity are not equally generic and, in particular they fail, if we want to apply them to attributed graphs. To solve this problem, in this paper, we define a special notion of symbolic graph bisimulation and show how it can be used to check bisimilarity of attributed graphs.", "authors": ["Fernando Orejas", "Artur Boronat", "Nikos Mylonakis"], "n_citation": 2, "references": ["11783b04-fad3-46df-ab80-5948f9eb8652", "141f358b-1022-435e-8186-6b41ae08cd30", "195ba62b-c634-45d1-818f-756e00b4d85c", "29c4c53d-548f-43ec-a405-bdae7c74b18f", "3b44d4bf-80c3-4c89-b522-7548d9fed55a", "4807db9a-c4e4-4d53-8ffd-62ce1921b009", "801a3b0b-26db-4ad4-b956-369a5a0a9c94", "86718b68-beb2-4201-8bce-845a80302bd2", "b0ea027d-3363-4212-9377-920db0d6b232", "d03fabe2-060a-42c6-8d37-155015c6ad5b"], "title": "Borrowed contexts for attributed graphs", "venue": "international conference on graph transformation", "year": 2012, "id": "6d6992cd-109d-4e50-bf6a-eb1597c766e2"}

{"abstract": "Previous research shows that blended learning has the ability to increase the learners' motivation and learning success. However, motivational aspects in blended learning have not been sufficiently researched yet. We therefore investigated the influence of non-monetary and monetary incentives on learners' behavior. We selected \"likes\" as a non-monetary incentive and enabled students to rate other students' posts (similar to Facebook). In a second turn, a monetary incentive (a tablet PC or the cash equivalent, respectively) was raffled among the students of a top 10 \"like\"-ranking. Based on log-file data and survey results, we observe that both variations ((1) only \"likes\" and (2) \"likes\" & tablet PC prize) do not differ with respect of their influence on the overall activity of learners during the lecture. Thus, the additional monetary incentive did not increase activity. We conclude that monetary incentives do not seem to be efficient.", "authors": ["Stefan Stieglitz", "Annika Eschmeier", "Michael Steiner"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["1bc8a52b-902f-4c2f-b085-e562869a59d1", "aa24618d-6507-40e2-9af9-1058be846037", "b51aeae7-bc2d-4c41-976a-2ff7fe6046bb", "d81057ea-29ed-4da2-8dcc-a1d75ff8a6f3", "d9230ea5-ce75-419e-b76a-b1e43a777b4c", "eeaab004-e706-4ad4-81d1-62a0c7eeffc4", "fe0af822-d514-40ca-9124-7fda5447cc57"], "title": "Influence of monetary and non-monetary incentives on students' behavior in blended learning settings in higher education", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "id": "6e3d5fb9-74ea-48ca-a18a-3d07ea180340"}

{"abstract": "A number of research efforts were devoted to deploying agent technology applications in the field of Agent-Mediated Electronic Commerce. On the one hand, there are applications that simplify electronic transactions such as intelligent search engines and browsers, learning agents, recommender agent systems and agents that share knowledge. Thanks to the development and availability of agent software, e-commerce can use more than only telecommunications and online data processing. On the other hand, there are applications that include negotiation as part of their core activities such as the information systems field with negotiation support systems; multi-agent systems field with searching, trading and negotiation agents; and market design field with electronic auctions. Although negotiation is an important business activity, it has not been studied extensively either in traditional business or in ecommerce context. This paper introduces the idea of developing an agent with negotiation capabilities applied to the Latin American market, where both the technological gap and an inappropriate approach to motivate electronic transactions are important factors.

{"abstract": "In general, the academic procrastination behaviour is a problem for many college students. A student procrastinates with regard to starting an assignment, and is unable to devote enough time to complete the assignment. As a result, there is a risk of a decrease in the quality of the assignment or of missing the deadline. This paper makes the hypothesis that procrastination is related to the following factors: (1) the difficulty of each assignment, (2) the student's interest in the programming used and in each assignment, (3) the level of procrastination, and (4) the student's understanding of the programming. This paper also performs a covariance structure analysis to confirm the relationships. According to the result of the analysis, there are also some problems in the analysis and in the model. In the future, we will improve the model and develop a system to prevent procrastination based on this model.", "authors": ["Kousuke Muramatsu", "Hisayoshi Kunimune", "Masaaki Niimura"], "n_citation": 0, "references": [], "title": "An analysis for the causes of the academic procrastination behaviour", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "id": "6e87935c-d1a1-4f4e-b60e-ff8650230ee6"}

{"abstract": "This paper presents an automatic approach for the detection of the prosodic structures of speech utterances. The algorithm relies on a hierarchical representation of the prosodic organization of the speech utterances. The approach is applied on a corpus of radio French broadcast news and also on radio and TV shows which are more spontaneous speech data. The algorithm detects prosodic boundaries whether they are followed or not by pause. The detection of the prosodic boundaries and of the prosodic structures is based on an approach that integrates little linguistic knowledge and mainly uses the amplitude of the F0 slopes and the inversion of the slopes as described in [1], as well as phone durations. The automatic prosodic segmentation results are then compared to a manual prosodic segmentation made by an expert phonetician. Finally, the results obtained by this automatic approach provide an insight into the most frequently used prosodic structures in the broadcasting speech style as well as in a more spontaneous speech style.", "authors": ["Katarina Bartkova", "Denis Jouvet"], "n_citation": 2, "references": ["6a37bf75-a61c-45d4-bb3c-1232ad3c4e0a", "f2f2e6b0-8879-43d4-acf0-1e54502c7b44"], "title": "Automatic Detection of the Prosodic Structures of Speech Utterances", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "id": "6ec63d1e-f335-4164-8ada-1a546a98fe20"}

Some reciprocal confusions indicate the similarities between different styles like News and Fast, Tale and Slow as well as Tale and Expressive. The confusions are more likely for synthetic speech. To produce e. g. the complex style Tale, different features of the prosodic variations Slow and Expressive are combined. The training method for the synthetic styles requires a further improvement.", "authors": ["Oliver Jokisch", "Hans Kruschke", "Riidiger Hoffmann"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0973c1cc-d790-45ce-8d8d-dc440681c121", "6a35f5c0-caa3-47dd-8102-2edc8431716c", "6b1c2248-773c-442a-a492-6bef67cba96d", "b71bc403-14bb-4c36-9641-bc8f5058d198", "c5343b0e-047a-4683-b8f5-95a579bb746c", "f9673488-4594-40cf-8aef-fbc7c436ecbd"], "title": "Prosodic reading style simulation for text-to-speech synthesis", "venue": "affective computing and intelligent interaction", "year": 2005, "id": "6ecaeb96-7252-4ffd-b75e-5c5402adbdbf"}

{"abstract": "A classical construction of stream ciphers is to combine several LFSRs and a highly non-linear Boolean function f. Their security is usually analysed in terms of correlation attacks, that can be seen as solving a system of multivariate linear equations, true with some probability. At ICISC'02 this approach is extended to systems of higher-degree multivariate equations, and gives an attack in 292 for Toyocrypt, a Cryptrec submission. In this attack the key is found by solving an overdefined system of algebraic equations. In this paper we show how to substantially lower the degree of these equations by multiplying them by well-chosen multivariate polynomials. Thus we are able to break Toyocrypt in 249 CPU clocks, with only 20 Kbytes of keystream, the fastest attack proposed so far. We also successfully attack the Nessie submission LILI-128, within 257 CPU clocks (not the fastest attack known). In general, we show that if the Boolean function uses only a small subset (e.g. 10) of state/LFSR bits, the cipher can be broken, whatever is the Boolean function used (worst case). Our new general algebraic attack breaks stream ciphers satisfying all the previously known design criteria in at most the square root of the complexity of the previously known generic attack.", "authors": ["Nicolas T.

{"abstract": "Recently, cloud computing gained more and more traction, not only in fast moving domains such as private and enterprise software, but also in more traditional domains like industrial automation. However, for rolling out automation software as a service solutions to low-end, long-tail markets with thousands of small customers important aspects for cloud scalability such as easy self service for the customer are still missing. There exists a large gap between the engineering efforts required to configure an automation system and the effort automation companies and their customers can afford. At the same time, tools for implementing Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) have recently become more and more efficient and easy to use. Tailored DSLs that make use of abstractions for the particular (sub-)domains and omitting other complexities would allow customers to handle their applications in a SaaS-oriented, self-service manner. In this paper, we present an approach towards a model-based infrastructure for engineering languages for a multi-domain automation cloud platform that make use of modern DSL frameworks. This will allow automation SaaS providers to rapidly design sub-domain specific engineering tools based on a common platform. End-customers can then use these tailored languages to engineer their specific applications in an efficient manner.", "authors": ["Thomas Goldschmidt"], "n_citation": 1, "references": ["72d4e713-0cea-4982-b6d0-564f0a8cdeec", "847d073e-2781-43bf-9a87-14516f5945da", "9dbd26c1-011c-4c74-a6af-df19140f4090", "ade628f8-f2ae-40d9-a2d6-83f18d2b942f", "cf6f4dc9-c642-4434-9b21-2f557bef5235"], "title": "Towards an Infrastructure for Domain-Specific Languages in a Multi-domain Cloud Platform", "venue": "european conference on modelling foundations and applications", "year": 2014, "id": "6ee7e169-341b-4e42-9376-f9e2ab8e0d75"}

{"abstract": "The fundamental tradeoff that is well known in Knowledge Representation and Reasoning affects Concept Learning from Examples too. Representation of learning examples using attribute-value has proved to support efficient inductive algorithms but limited expressiveness whereas more expressive representation languages, typically subsets of First Order Logic (FOL), are supported by less efficient algorithms. In fact, an underlying problem is that of the number of different ways of matching examples, just one in attribute-value representation and potentially large in FOL representation. This paper describes a novel approach to perform representation shifts on learning examples. The structure of these learning examples, initially represented using a subset of FOL-based languages, is reformulated so as to produce new learning examples that are represented using an attribute-value language. What is considered to be an adequate structure varies according to the learning task. We introduce the notion of  morion  (from the Greek) to qualify this structure and show, through a concrete example, the advantages it offers. We then describe an algorithm which reformulates learning examples automatically and go on to analyze its complexity. This approach to deductive reformulation is implemented in the REMO system that has been experimented on the learning of the construction of Chinese characters.", "authors": ["Jean-Daniel Zucker", "Jean-Gabriel Ganascia"], "n_citation": 23, "references": ["052723b5-c0ae-4938-a2ea-6660f64bd5ad", "0ad46374-050d-42d5-9c8c-2d50b61413e8", "1cdc11fa-7c34-4a2b-8364-3d3af84c43f7", "34746e29-6e84-44bc-af8c-74e1592d8052", "37609693-69c6-493f-8e7b-fe25883e944e", "4183f2b6-fdc6-424b-b20f-7ecd10685ebe", "4516543e-c8bb-4b21-818e-dad61ff606d0", "57c15698-916e-42d2-a176-3679f64d6061", "5899eb6c-2e22-4d79-a2be-15fe67911177", "79c275c0-6fc1-40e4-877e-9c274dc0e8b6", "86212f33-ea23-450c-ab2d-78360e78a7c2", "92ba5271-a1fe-435c-add7-0dbac1930011", "92c2d825-aa3f-4956-829b-670ded171bf8", "a9734cd4-1a64-4249-8657-8a3e8bf090ec", "b49c1e2b-0cd0-4950-a724-00c698e5b49d", "b63705f2-4f2b-416e-9060-82cb5680ed94", "df93a495-460d-475b-8acf-4622b204556c", "e2f7ac35-4c60-4f95-b5cf-3a20005cf505"], "title": "Selective Reformulation of Examples in Concept Learning", "venue": "international conference on machine learning", "year": 1994, "id": "6eff9cfb-9e52-4c50-a148-c713dd05ff83"}
{"abstract": "Deadlock detection is an important service that the run-time system of a parallel environment should provide. In parallel programs deadlock can occur when the different processes are waiting for various events, as opposed to concurrent systems, where deadlock occurs when processes wait for resources held by other processes. Therefore classical deadlock detection techniques such as checking for cycles in the wait-for graph are unapplicable. An alternative algorithm that checks whether all the processes are blocked is presented. This algorithm deals with situations in which the state transition from blocked to unblocked is indirect, as may happen when busy-waiting is used.", "authors": ["Dror G.

{"abstract": "This research concerns the comparison of three different artificial evolution approaches for the design of cooperative behavior in a group of simulated mobile robots. The first and second approaches, termed: single pools and plasticity, are characterized by robots that share a single genotype, though the plasticity approach includes a learning mechanism. The third approach, termed: multiple pools, is characterized by robots that use different genotypes. The application domain is a pursuit-evasion game in which a team of robots, termed: predators, collectively work to capture or slow a single robot, termed: the prey. Results indicate that the multiple pools approach is superior comparative to the other two approaches in deriving robust and consistently effective prey-capture strategies, given that this approach facilitates the evolution of specialized behavioral roles in the predator team.", "authors": ["Geoff Nitschke"], "n_citation": 1, "references": ["0f90ea3b-cf7f-44e2-993d-fd39429c16ab", "5aad44c6-ac71-40ab-8567-16c9cd2373c6", "89debc72-0161-43e8-9388-ae3c3594bee7", "dee598f5-5bc3-4516-bf9b-f0856f7ac890", "dee7b9b3-f3ca-4f48-86b2-5d1cf47cb984"], "title": "Emergence of Cooperation in a Multiple Predator, Single Prey Game", "venue": "the florida ai research society", "year": 2003, "id": "6fcc99d3-8717-4028-a2af-546acbd780d5"}

{"abstract": "The automated generation of test cases for heap allocated, complex, structures is particularly difficult. Various state of the art tools tackle this problem by bounded exhaustive exploration of potential test cases, using constraint solving mechanisms based on techniques such as search, model checking, symbolic execution and combinations of these. In this article we present a technique for improving the bounded exhaustive constraint based test case generation of structurally complex inputs, for \"filtering\" approaches. The technique works by guiding the search considering a given black box test criterion. Such a test criterion is incorporated in the constraint based mechanism so that the exploration of potential test cases can be pruned without missing coverable classes of inputs, corresponding to the test criterion.#R##N##R##N#We present the technique, together with some case studies illustrating its performance for some black box testing criteria.

{"abstract": "One of the main goals of Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) is to detect the mucosal abnormalities such as blood, ulcer, polyp, and so on in the gastrointestinal tract. Only less than 5% of total 55,000 frames of a WCE video typically have abnormalities, so it is critical to develop a technique to automatically discriminate abnormal findings from normal ones. We introduce \"Bag-of-Visual-Words\" method which has been successfully used in particular for image classification in non-medical domains. Initially the training image patches are represented by color and texture features, and then the bag of words model is constructed by K-means clustering algorithm. Subsequently the document is represented as the histogram of the visual words which is the feature vector of the image. Finally, a SVM classifier is trained using these feature vectors to distinguish images with abnormal regions from ones without them. Experimental results on our current data set show that the proposed method achieves promising performances.", "authors": ["Sae Hwang"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["26316adf-569e-49bc-a289-c1ba311624f6", "4bbd7777-9751-415d-bb7a-6ce26f6d9271", "69a46388-5c04-4a86-b7b8-b27307c6257b", "7e578899-6e08-4604-bbfa-fd66137daf38", "82d280b8-5cbe-4ff4-bcbd-e7290262f922", "91979159-37d8-410f-a245-a33ef80a092b", "b9e84425-a588-4c6e-a763-890f63f16093", "e246f681-59fe-4d59-8fe7-85638181cae3", "eda66acd-752c-4daf-8d57-e10f48a88b31", "f519b0aa-4f8c-4a58-a5fb-d050eb5f2534"], "title": "Bag-of-visual-words approach to abnormal image detection in wireless capsule endoscopy videos", "venue": "international symposium on visual computing", "year": 2011, "id": "6ff5e83f-c769-4f0a-9e7e-e1cacad85f79"}

{"abstract": "Complex adaptive systems (CAS) modeling has become a common tool to study the behavioral dynamics of agents in a broad range of disciplines from ecology to economics. Many modelers have studied structure's importance for a system in equilibrium, while others study the effects of perturbations on system dynamics. There is a notable absence of work on the effects of agent interaction pathways on perturbation dynamics. We present an agent-based CAS model of a competitive economic environment. We use this model to study the perturbation dynamics of simple structures by introducing a series of disruptive events and observing key system metrics. Then, we generate more complex networks by combining the simple component structures and analyze the resulting dynamics. We find the local network structure of a perturbed node to be a valuable indicator of the system response.", "authors": ["Marshall A Kuypers", "Walter E. Beyeler", "Robert J.

{"abstract": "In this paper we look into a simple approach for generating character- based stories using planning and the language of PDDL. A story often involves modalities over properties and objects, such as what the characters believe, de- sire, request, etc. We look into a practical approach that reifies such modalities into normal objects of the planning domain, and relies on a \"mood\" predicate to represent the disposition of characters based on these objects. A short story is then generated by specifying a goal for the planning problem expressed in terms of the moods of the characters of the story. As a case study of how such a domain for story generation is modeled, we investigate the story of the first book of Homer's Iliad as a solution of an appropriate PDDL domain and problem description.", "authors": ["Andrea Marrella", "Stavros Vassos"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["2e60579d-2049-48c5-82a6-bd5878028bb8", "2f07261f-e6c1-4108-9ec6-46bf6e9b4649", "507d931e-d5bb-48a5-ae7d-90ca0420847e", "62c25a78-c1fc-41a3-8bac-f379d3197e0f", "7102e92f-2715-4546-8e03-858116ff7329", "fa0b7442-2223-407e-aada-572d77d6c5e5"], "title": "Story Generation in PDDL Using Character Moods: A Case Study on Iliad's First Book", "venue": "hellenic conference on artificial intelligence", "year": 2014, "id": "720a131c-e054-45e3-833d-1fd16e06220d"}

{"abstract": "There are two opposite views on whether working memory can guide visual attention. Some researchers have reported that the contents of working memory guide visual attention for capturing target efficiently. However, others reported that they could not find any evidence of attention capture by working memory. In this study, it tried to find evidence for the first view with computer simulation. Two models based on two hypotheses were set up in simulating the simplified 4\u00d74 Sudoku problem solving by which an fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) experiment was performed at the same time. One model is based on working memory guiding visual selective attention assumption while the other is based on no guiding random attention assumption. Both of the models predict the response time (RT) and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response. Cognitive cost analysis on the predictions shows that more cost was occupied on no guiding model resulting in more differences between fMRI real data and predictions while the other can reduce the cost and get good fitness. This study confirms the first view and shows that working memory guiding visual search for capturing target is the intelligence of human brain in reducing the cognitive cost.", "authors": ["Rifeng Wang"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["048d7057-0449-46ec-ae0e-6a10612b396a"], "title": "Simulating Working Memory Guiding Visual Attention for Capturing Target by Computational Cognitive Model", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "id": "72206a3a-3fc0-4505-a5ef-2bb23ab253e0"}

{"abstract": "Distributed Virtual Environments (DVEs) are geographically distributed computing systems which allow multiple users to interact simultaneously in computer-generated, shared virtual environments. DVEs are widely applied in many fields, such as online role playing games, synthesis military simulations, virtual cities, and virtual shopping malls. To support large-scale DVEs with high fidelity and satisfied interactive performance among various distributed clients, massive computing resources, storage resources, and highly efficient distributed server architectures are needed. In this paper, the key techniques of the system design and implementation for large scale Distributed Virtual Environment on the Grid (DVE-G) are discussed and a hierarchical architecture of DVE-G is proposed. Some aspects of DVE-G, such as resource management, massive data management, scene synchronization, and fault-tolerance are also discussed.

In particular, both possible misjudgment and dishonesty threaten the quality of the results. Common countermeasures are based on redundancy, giving way to a tradeoff between result quality and throughput. Ideally, measures should (1) maintain high throughput and (2) ensure high result quality at the same time. Existing work on crowdsourcing mostly focuses on result quality, paying little attention to throughput or even to that tradeoff. One reason is that the number of tasks (individual atomic units of work) is usually small. A further problem is that the tasks users work on are small as well. In consequence, existing result-improvement mechanisms do not scale to the number or complexity of tasks that arise, for instance, in proofreading and processing of digitized legacy literature. This paper proposes novel resultimprovement mechanisms that (1) are independent of the size and complexity of tasks and (2) allow to trade result quality for throughput to a significant extent. Both mathematical analyses and extensive simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms.", "authors": ["Guido Sautter", "Klemens B\u00f6hm"], "n_citation": 2, "references": ["0d60a7b8-b904-4dd3-ad20-73f403c407f7", "289ad4f0-9807-4eb8-a752-20e840135aac", "3cae0a8f-2709-4bb3-b818-abe89a050d7e", "780582e8-8f1b-4feb-9899-3aac3302f061", "974b61eb-0266-43ea-89f5-530f6713ea7a", "d4e2d583-7449-4601-a5d8-6a65ff7b8812", "f55a7917-f1d7-4f5a-ab4a-c62d84f00cd5", "f87ba1e2-9563-46d1-9761-f7b239e970aa"], "title": "High-throughput crowdsourcing mechanisms for complex tasks", "venue": "social informatics", "year": 2011, "id": "73dbdd9c-1c32-453b-849c-ad2fb5bcc59d"}

{"abstract": "One of the main challenges in the design of real-time systems is how to derive correct and efficient implementations from platform-independent specifications.#R##N##R##N#We present a general implementation method in which the application is represented by an abstract model consisting of a set of interacting components. The abstract model executes sequentially components interactions atomically and instantaneously. We transform abstract models into physical models representing their execution on a platform. Physical models take into account execution times of interactions and allow their parallel execution. They are obtained by breaking atomicity of interactions using a notion of partial state. We provide safety conditions guaranteeing that the semantics of abstract models is preserved by physical models. These provide bases for implementing a parallel execution engine coordinating the execution of the components. The implementation has been validated on a real robotic application.

Thus, we propose an ascending method for building local and global ontologies, which facilitates the semantic reconciliation between data sources. Moreover, we use OWL (Ontology Web Language) for defining mappings between data sources, and ontologies. We also propose a language to formulate user queries. The query language handles global ontology concepts and local ontologies properties because we assume that the user is expert in its domain. Finally, we propose a query rewriting strategy: queries are decomposed to obtain a set of equivalent subqueries that are sent to the corresponding data sources for execution, and after that recomposed to obtain the final result.", "authors": ["Nora Maiz", "Omar Boussaid", "Fadila Bentayeb"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["06ff1f11-5511-4222-867b-432f878cf726", "17b8289c-d9e6-43fc-a5b6-a1430f7fbf15", "3d53a2e5-f398-4a1d-bcca-24cff3bd6621", "4f7d5280-29b9-42a2-b95f-bfa8e7961265", "620150d0-8acf-467e-b69d-dd831c5b59c9", "add64654-91c9-4552-a507-83cd4afb7d3a", "db229d9e-2e77-4110-b439-224b2551c418"], "title": "Ontology-Based mediation system", "venue": "", "year": 2006, "id": "74d3b5f2-41a4-4e21-b828-1e495e2d38ec"}
{"abstract": "In this paper, a mathematical model and a solution algorithm are developed for solving an extended capacitated concentrator location problem. Our model extends the conventional formulation by simultaneously addressing the two capacity constraints, total connection ports and maximum data processing rate, on each concentrator to be selected for satisfying the communication demands of the given end-user nodes. Since the problem is NP-complete, an efficient and effective Lagrangian heuristic is developed and tested by solving 100 randomly generated test problems with sizes ranging from 30(nodes)\u00d730(concentrators) to150\u00d730. Altogether 58% of the tested problems are solved optimally with an average solution gap 0.36% from the optimality and average solution times are from a few seconds to one half of a minute.", "authors": ["V.

{"abstract": "A concept to speech generation was realized in an agent dialogue system, where an agent (a stuffed animal) walked around in a small room constructed on a computer display to complete some jobs with instructions from a user. The communication between the user and the agent was done through speech. If the agent could not complete the job because of some difficulties, it tried to solve the problems through conversations with the user. Different from other spoken dialogue systems, the speech output from the agent was generated directly from the concept, and was synthesized using higher linguistic information. This scheme could largely improve the prosodic quality of speech output. In order to realize the concept to speech conversion, the linguistic information was handled as a tree structure in the whole dialogue process.", "authors": ["Keikichi Hirose", "Junji Tago", "Nobuaki Minematsu"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["15b0c806-f6f3-41e2-89e8-419d27bf4ac1", "2441ccb4-a6e7-4b4e-bfe7-07f20725c1fb"], "title": "Speech Generation from Concept for Realizing Conversation with an Agent in a Virtual Room", "venue": "conference of the international speech communication association", "year": 2003, "id": "7522dfc2-45e6-4519-9280-7bc08176ff3d"}

{"abstract": "This paper addresses itself to a portfolio optimization problem under nonconvex transaction costs and minimal transaction unit constraints. Associated with portfolio construction is a fee for purchasing assets. Unit transaction fee is larger when the amount of transaction is smaller. Hence the transaction cost is usually a concave function up to certain point. When the amount of transaction increases, the unit price of assets increases due to illiquidity/market impact effects. Hence the transaction cost becomes convex beyond certain bound. Therefore, the net expected return becomes a general d.c. function (difference of two convex functions). We will propose a branch-and-bound algorithm for the resulting d.c. maximization problem subject to a constraint on the level of risk measured in terms of the absolute deviation of the rate of return of a portfolio. Also, we will show that the minimal transaction unit constraints can be incorporated without excessively increasing the amount of computation.", "authors": ["Hiroshi Konno", "Annista Wijayanayake"], "n_citation": 12, "references": ["410cc234-06e6-4600-875e-f45e65ee88d2", "ad42518d-2892-48bb-b825-e29f64f0f10c"], "title": "Portfolio optimization under D.C. transaction costs and minimal transaction unit constraints", "venue": "Journal of Global Optimization", "year": 2002, "id": "7628a76e-4b02-4da4-9b6c-8e92e9a960a9"}

{"abstract": "The introduction of task-level parallelization promises to raise the level of abstraction compared to thread-centric expression of parallelism. However, tasks might exhibit poor performance on NUMA systems if locality cannot be maintained. In contrast to traditional OpenMP worksharing constructs for which threads can be bound, the behavior of tasks is much less predetermined by the OpenMP specification and implementations have a high degree of freedom implementing task scheduling.#R##N##R##N#Employing different approaches to express task-parallelism, namely the single-producer and parallel-producer patterns with different data initialization strategies, we compare the behavior and quality of OpenMP implementations with task-parallel codes on NUMA architectures. For the programmer, we propose recipies to express parallelism with tasks allowing to preserve data locality while optimizing the degree of parallelism.

{"abstract": "Today, many companies still struggle in documenting and reusing the knowledge gained by project teams. However, knowledge only creates value if it is applied. There exists a vast amount of research in the field of knowledge management focusing on documentation, storage and exchange of knowledge, but knowledge reuse is often omitted by researchers. The presented work aims to close this gap by developing a project knowledge management system enabling project teams to apply company-internal knowledge. We followed an action design research approach to explore meta-requirements in a case company, translate these requirements into design principles and test the design principles by evaluating an artifact of a project knowledge management system. By our work, the knowledge management research field can benefit since our design theory extends the existing body of knowledge. Furthermore, our research results are instantiated in a concrete artifact which can be directly transferred into practice.", "authors": ["Silvia Schacht", "Alexander M\u00e4dche"], "n_citation": 13, "references": ["0b29edfa-1b28-43c6-a397-dcb0c21a220c", "0ffbba6a-4711-4e10-ad37-358bd8cb6873", "1c90fb8d-13aa-4c27-a56d-ddeca8e5a605", "23381899-4eef-4064-b721-895ea71616cf", "32772998-6b13-43eb-8121-d61edd54c509", "52fc5b3c-1ba4-4c27-aacf-82aa9d3945a4", "58a372ec-006f-4ef0-8197-f12c53d6529e", "606ca390-b34f-47d1-b0cb-c8ca1edd7aca", "6f3bc785-f312-4385-bc85-49dd63969cf2", "7bf31d93-41a0-4050-a8b0-b6f0f0db69ef", "80173700-4ddd-4f03-8313-859dad0d11f6", "806080a0-7548-4167-943b-d2e075082dad", "80698658-ee39-4df4-bd1a-a09150149d00", "a3d4a2d1-d9dd-4f4d-9d8e-bcc056135d21", "ab8d0f3e-b9f7-42ab-a938-de70c2e0f87c", "adb758ed-d607-45d3-b4ef-ceeee342dbd3", "af03585d-1de6-4196-adec-8e45d7d470d3", "b5314a1b-e87d-4605-b387-e199e9ab5cb5", "bf22519c-7596-44b7-8102-7256ab462fbb", "c5906db3-9908-4fe9-97ca-f23ece3e8f76", "c5f81b4f-5a94-407f-9c05-51a6905927fa", "cf2aa5aa-3c2f-49a7-a7e5-880bfa849a69", "d0dd90d0-2cd1-4199-aca2-bb65114d0f58", "df406472-de42-42c7-ab8b-f899db0e8640", "e571ddaf-49d9-41cd-81f7-79ce35d76572", "e5767879-f411-46ae-9e47-be1dc2b893ec", "e5aa7053-fd81-40b4-8cf2-7517a4ae2c2c", "eeb82c52-8a66-4f3f-a29f-017e302a319b", "f2ed221d-fde6-40dd-9dc2-d1a227ed010b"], "title": "How to prevent reinventing the wheel?: design principles for project knowledge management systems", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "id": "767ad56b-cfe5-46c1-aac5-42f3e8cfd628"}

{"abstract": "The unprecedented use of social media through smartphones and other web-enabled mobile devices has enabled the rapid adoption of platforms like Twitter. Event detection has found many applications on the web, including breaking news identification and summarization. The recent increase in the usage of Twitter during crises has attracted researchers to focus on detecting events in tweets. However, current solutions have focused on static Twitter data. The necessity to detect events in a streaming environment during fast paced events such as a crisis presents new opportunities and challenges. In this paper, we investigate event detection in the context of real-time Twitter streams as observed in real-world crises. We highlight the key challenges in this problem: the informal nature of text, and the high volume and high velocity characteristics of Twitter streams. We present a novel approach to address these challenges using single-pass clustering and the compression distance to efficiently detect events in Twitter streams. Through experiments on large Twitter datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to detect events in near real-time and can scale to large and noisy Twitter streams.", "authors": ["Shamanth Kumar", "Huan Liu", "Sameep Mehta", "L.

{"abstract": "We present in this paper a hybrid planning system Which combines constraint satisfaction techniques and planning heuristics to produce optimal sequential plans. It integrates its own consistency rules and filtering and decomposition mechanisms suitable for planning. Given a fixed bound on the plan length, our planner works directly on a structure related to Graphplan's planning graph. This structure is incrementally built: Each time it is extended, a sequential plan is searched. Different search strategies may be employed. Currently, it is a forward chaining search based on problem decomposition with action sets partitioning. Various techniques are used to reduce the search space, such as memorizing nogood states or estimating goals reachability. In addition, the planner implements two different techniques to avoid enumerating some equivalent action sequences. Empirical evaluation shows that our system is very competitive on many problems, especially compared to other optimal sequential planners.", "authors": ["St\u00e9phane Grandcolas", "Cyril Pain-Barre"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["10b6bf0f-bc3f-4e8d-bd30-bb5864df72fd", "14084be4-431c-4c37-a820-d53876d56800", "186fbb96-122a-48bf-b047-0693aa3d56ef", "539f1d81-6d21-4f16-b49f-938c4c94efe9", "78177b8f-531b-40f0-8656-9ea74ec3e0d5", "7935e23a-7450-4837-b5c2-d6da723d31a8", "82bbf74b-1531-414f-97fd-0296f1c13bd6", "84f6729f-393a-472e-8aab-2fda338d5748", "8be0560b-e8ca-472e-a198-4494b51ac2b4", "b7e1c24a-af37-4167-892b-29b070b51e8b", "cd973d57-7cf3-43e2-bbf5-213173c402c2", "e55dc365-8669-4113-99c3-00ac394ab36e", "f7f9a2f4-f4f2-4abf-9b48-c5158fad85e0", "fbd702d9-cb5a-408f-b2ef-650e790ace06"], "title": "Filtering, decomposition and search space reduction for optimal sequential planning", "venue": "national conference on artificial intelligence", "year": 2007, "id": "76eaa096-e82d-494b-beb0-0248b11223bc"}

The results of this research suggest that the ISD transactions are embedded in the social relations, implying that social relations and ISD must be managed jointly to achieve a successful (system solution) project.

{"abstract": "Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSM) are immensely popu- lar because they can meet the huge capacity needs of industrial applications. Speed regulation of PMSM Drives with conventional Proportional-Integral (PI) regulator reduces the speed control precision because of the disturbances in Motor and load characteristics, leading to poor performance of whole system. The values so ob- tained may not give satisfactory results in a wide range of speed. In this research, we considered the Mathematical model of speed controller for controlling the speed, which can be formulated as an optimization problem subject to various constraints imposed due to motor and other limitation factors. For solving this problem we used a modified version of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm known as Cauchy Mu- tation ABC (C-ABC). We first illustrate the proposed method using various standard benchmark functions and then it is used for tuning PI controller for speed regulation in PMSM drive. Empirical results obtained are compared with the basic version of ABC, which clearly indicates the superior performance of the C-ABC algorithm.", "authors": ["Anguluri Rajasekhar", "Ajith Abraham", "Ravi Kumar Jatoth"], "n_citation": 10, "references": ["a2a0d7ee-8fa9-46fe-9e0b-a2f3702e9af4", "c19fc960-72a3-41d1-9121-4a7ed12ad9e3"], "title": "Controller Tuning Using a Cauchy Mutated Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm", "venue": "Soft Computing", "year": 2011, "id": "77707240-3091-4963-9f1e-4dd59c3f825d"}

{"abstract": "Several secure extensions have been proposed to deal with the OLSR proactive routing protocol security, but they often involve a very high resource consumption that degrades network performances. The protocol ADVSIG is one of these extensions. It presents an efficient security approach, but generates very high computational costs due to the cryptographic operations it performs on the control messages. In this paper, we present a secure mechanism for OLSR, based on ADVSIG protocol, that we call ADVHCA. Its purpose is to improve ADVSIG performances using hash chains to reduce the cost of securing HELLO control messages. A watching mechanism is also proposed to counter the wormhole attack.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel technique for super-resolution imaging of a scene from observations at different zoom levels. Given a sequence of images with different zoom factors of a static scene, the problem is to obtain a picture of the entire scene at a resolution corresponding to the most zoomed image in the scene. We not only obtain the super-resolved image for known integer zoom factors, but also for unknown arbitrary zoom factors. We model the super-resolution image as a Markov random field (MRF) and a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation method is used to derive a cost function which is then optimized to recover the high-resolution field. The entire observation conforms to the same MRF, but is viewed at the different resolution pyramid. Since there is no relative motion between the scene and the camera, as is the case with most of the super-resolution techniques, we do away with the correspondence problem. Results of the experimentation on real data are presented.", "authors": ["Manjunath V.

{"abstract": "Panorama has the full directional view of the scene and can provide an object vision persistently from its emerging to vanishing except occlusion. Though, traditional tracking algorithms are apt to fail since the object may change its appearance or even disappear occasionally during its display lifetime. A persistent object tracking algorithm for static objects in panoramic videos is proposed in this paper. It creates several auxiliary trackers to guide the tracking. Once the object is obscured or deformed, the auxiliary trackers are engaged in estimating the position of the main tracker. Even though the appearance of the object changes a lot, its position still could be estimated with help of the auxiliary trackers. Experiment results illustrated that this algorithm provides a real-time tracking effectively on signs in road panoramic videos. This algorithm is easy to perform and especially valuable for road sign labeling and management.", "authors": ["Yuan Zhou", "Zhong Zhou", "Ke Chen", "Wei Wu"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0ae61c32-f756-46b3-8932-b40313e48939", "3baf7125-32d2-4b68-be3b-148377f12718", "84438d0e-e639-4ce3-a054-899ec1f9607d", "88905171-bd24-4eb2-9193-71f750b02b94", "910a223b-1f53-4100-a600-6cce47c85f1d", "aec0c97d-ccad-4b2b-a278-df35396f7223", "b8da0182-d7ce-4905-a988-9b0634d515e3", "ce53f087-d1c4-43e2-9982-f69700cb5d20", "d3615da5-69dd-493e-9d76-eef24876347e", "eaa85e09-34ef-4091-bcf0-d74b70680a29", "f2a4c64e-23a5-4770-a06c-5de46da9ef29", "f2fe4ebb-8f7b-4123-ad1d-2dcad090a7a6"], "title": "Persistent object tracking in road panoramic videos", "venue": "advances in multimedia", "year": 2012, "id": "78d2003d-874f-41df-b77e-62647eff51a5"}

{"abstract": "Scalable implementations of sparse Cholesky factorization use block mappings of the dense parts of the matrix onto a 2-D processor grid, mappings which reduce communication cost. With naive cyclic mappings, block-oriented approaches (specifically, the block fan-out method) suffer from poor balance of the computational load and modest efficiency. Here, we show that heuristic remapping of the block rows and columns essentially removes load imbalance as a cause of inefficiency, producing a 20% increase in realized performance on a 196-node Paragon multicomputer. To attack the remaining inefficiency, we consider the scheduling of available tasks at each node.

{"abstract": "Developing systems and services for the effective and efficient management of research data as well as addressing issues around their long term curation is an area of increasing activity in UK Higher Education. This paper discusses some preliminary results from a questionnaire survey, conducted as part of the trial implementation of the Data Audit Framework Methodology at University College London (UCL). Fifty seven (57) academic and research staff from 5 designated departments and an interdisciplinary research centre provided information about the nature of their research and the types of primary research data they produce. The survey explored factors that could impact on access, use and preservation of such data. The preliminary results indicate that researchers recognise the potential usefulness of such data for other researchers as well as their long term value. Retaining primary research data after the end of the funding period and re-using them for initiating further research are practices already acknowledged. However, ownership, copyright and restrictions on access to research data can be hazy areas for academic and research staff and require further investigation, advice and support.

{"abstract": "BitTorrent (BT) is currently the main P2P protocol used for sharing large files over the Internet. It is therefore important to understand the performance characteristics of existing real-world BT implementations (clients). In this work, we measure the download speed of over 10 million BT users over one month. Surprisingly, our measurements show that the two most famous BT clients, namely uTorrent and Vuze (Azureus), achieve different download speeds for the same set of torrents. In particular, we observe that uTorrent users achieve 16% faster download speed than users of Vuze in our data set. To shed light to the cause of this difference, we reverse engineer the two clients to infer their individual design choices. Our study shows that the two clients differ in two important areas: (a) how they manage their neighborhood, and (b) how they distribute their upload capacity to their peers. We speculate that the cause of the mismatch in download speeds can be attribute to these differences. We hope that our findings will open the door for new research efforts to better understand the impact of design choices in the performance of real-world BT implementations.", "authors": ["Marios Iliofotou", "Georgos Siganos", "Xiaoyuan Yang", "Pablo Rodriguez"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["1fbf5388-cffe-4abc-b809-c9119bf9f39c", "2cd1e1c8-e2f8-4aea-8bee-13dd3071203e", "335d3ecf-c8b9-42d4-94c0-3fa53a7c6487", "50d2d1ab-8756-4775-99b1-18d50a241dfc", "82b018d0-71c7-4f44-b7d7-45095ea74091", "9b4d855b-7439-42d3-920d-ea3b4d4c5004", "e4f37366-5b81-4e07-8a56-7b197f56e1d2", "ed5533a6-6b1a-4d50-a213-6e5a6eb6bce4"], "title": "Comparing BitTorrent clients in the wild: the case of download speed", "venue": "international workshop on peer to peer systems", "year": 2010, "id": "791d78fe-cfeb-4fc8-8410-8fdab0951e29"}

Our algorithm uses ideas from an algorithm presented in [5], but is considerably simpler and at the same time more structured and rigorous. We specify the assumptions and behavior of our algorithm as traces of Timed Input/Output Automata, and prove its correctness using this formalism. Our algorithm is based on a composition of independent subalgorithms solving variants of the classical leader election and shared register problems in distributed computing. The modularity of our algorithm facilitates its understanding and analysis, and can also aid in optimizing the algorithm or proving lower bounds. Our work demonstrates that formal methods can be feasibly applied to complex real-world problems to improve and simplify their solutions.", "authors": ["Rui Fan", "Ralph Droms", "Nancy D.

{"abstract": "Delineating brain tumor boundaries from magnetic resonance images is an essential task for the analysis of brain cancer. We propose a fully automatic method for brain tissue segmentation, which combines Support Vector Machine classification using multispectral intensities and textures with subsequent hierarchical regularization based on Conditional Random Fields. The CRF regularization introduces spatial constraints to the powerful SVM classification, which assumes voxels to be independent from their neighbors. The approach first separates healthy and tumor tissue before both regions are subclassified into cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, gray matter and necrotic, active, edema region respectively in a novel hierarchical way. The hierarchical approach adds robustness and speed by allowing to apply different levels of regularization at different stages. The method is fast and tailored to standard clinical acquisition protocols. It was assessed on 10 multispectral patient datasets with results outperforming previous methods in terms of segmentation detail and computation times.", "authors": ["Stefan Bauer", "Lutz-Peter Nolte", "Mauricio Reyes"], "n_citation": 183, "references": ["3a988488-7f4a-44a2-9e22-0a549ba775ba", "5ed9c441-3ed5-4d05-b4a2-dcc311d1dbce", "a083a1b9-8dfb-45d6-99a9-fa30c4a6e9f5", "ad7a6b80-1102-407a-a41b-edcfa2449771", "c1b6b493-01ef-420f-be44-7bacfe34e846"], "title": "Fully automatic segmentation of brain tumor images using support vector machine classification in combination with hierarchical conditional random field regularization", "venue": "medical image computing and computer assisted intervention", "year": 2011, "id": "79cda214-f8ae-4ff2-93a8-c757ace362d1"}

{"abstract": "In this paper we propose a solution to the problem of distinguishing between causal and acausal temporal sets of rules. The method, called the Temporal Investigation Method for Enregistered Record Sequences (TIMERS), is explained and introduced formally. The input to TIMERS consists of a sequence of records, where each record is observed at regular intervals. Sets of rules are generated from the input data using different window sizes and directions of time. The set of rules may describe an instantaneous relationship, where the decision attribute depends on condition attributes seen at the same time instant. We investigate the temporal characteristics of the system by changing the direction of time when generating temporal rules to see whether a set of rules is causal or acausal. The results are used to declare a verdict as to the nature of the system: instantaneous, causal, or acausal.", "authors": ["Kamran Karimi", "Howard J.

{"abstract": "JavaScript has become a central technology of the web, but it is also the source of many security problems, including cross-site scripting attacks and malicious advertising code. Central to these problems is the fact that code from untrusted sources runs with the same privileges as trusted code in the same frame. #R##N#While much work has been done to secure JavaScript in a somewhat piecemeal approach, information flow analysis presents a compelling option for providing a more systemic solution to the problem. By tracking the flow of sensitive information in the browser, we can prevent it from leaking out to untrusted sources. Formally, information flow analysis can provide non-interference, the guarantee that public outputs do not depend on private inputs. #R##N#Previous information flow techniques have primarily relied on static type systems. While effective, they are an awkward fit for dynamically typed JavaScript code. This dissertation explores three different runtime enforcement mechanisms that can guarantee non-interference dynamically. #R##N#The no-sensitive-upgrade check forbids updating public reference cells in a private context through the use of a runtime monitor. This approach can be done with minimal performance overhead by using a sparse-labeling strategy, which leaves security labels on data implicit whenever possible. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of this approach. #R##N#While the no-sensitive-upgrade check is effective, it sometimes rejects valid program executions that do not violate the security property. The permissive upgrade strategy is a refinement of this approach that still guarantees non-interference, but which accepts strictly more executions. When a public reference cell is updated in a private context, the permissive upgrade strategy marks the data as partially leaked rather than terminating execution. Partially leaked data is carefully tracked to avoid leaking private information. #R##N#The final approach introduces special faceted values, which capture multiple views for a single object. Faceted values simulate multiple executions for different security levels, giving the following benefits: (1) Faceted values do not rely on the stuck executions of the no-sensitive-upgrade and permissive upgrade approaches, and therefore accept strictly more programs than either of the monitor-based approaches. (2) Faceted values avoid redundant computations, improving efficiency over related approaches. #R##N#Finally we implement faceted values in Firefox and show how they may be used to prevent a variety of attacks.", "authors": ["Cormac Flanagan", "Thomas H.

{"abstract": "Psychometric instruments, inventories, surveys, and questionnaires are widely accepted tools in the field of behavioral health. They are used extensively in primary and clinical research, patient care, quality measurement, and payor oversight. To accurately capture and communicate instrument-related activities and results in electronic systems, existing healthcare standards must be capable of representing the full range of psychometric instruments used in research and clinical care. Several terminologies and controlled vocabularies contain representations of psychological instruments. While a handful of studies have assessed the representational adequacy of terminologies in this domain, no study to date has assessed content coverage. The current study was designed to fill this gap. Using a sample of 63 commonly used instruments, we found no concept in any of the three terminologies evaluated for more than half of all instruments. Of the three terminologies studied, SNOMED CT (Standard Nomenclature of Medicine \u2013 Clinical Terms) had the greatest breadth, but least granular coverage of all systems. While SNOMED CT contained concepts for over one third (36%) of the instrument classes in this sample, only 11% of the actual instruments were represented in SNOMED CT. LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers, Names, and Codes), on the other hand, was able to represent instruments with the greatest level of granularity of the three terminologies. However, LOINC had the poorest coverage, covering fewer than 8% of the instruments in our sample. Given that instruments selected for this study were selected on the basis of their status as gold standard measures for conditions most likely to present in clinical settings, we believe these results overestimate the actual coverage provided by these terminologies. The results of this study demonstrate significant gaps in existing healthcare terminologies vis-a-vis psychological instruments and instrument-related procedures. Based on these findings, we recommend that systematic efforts be made to enhance standard healthcare terminologies to provide better coverage of this domain.", "authors": ["Piper A.

{"abstract": "In data-parallel languages such as High Performance Fortran and Fortran D, arrays are mapped to processors through a two-step process involving alignment followed by distribution. A compiler that generates code for each processor has to compute the sequence of local memory addresses accessed by each processor and the sequence of sends and receives for a given processor to access non-local data. In this chapter, we present a novel approach to the address sequence generation problem based on integer lattices. When the alignment stride is one, the mapping is called a one-level mapping. In the case of one-level mapping, the set of elements referenced can be generated by integer linear combinations of basis vectors. Using the basis vectors we derive a loop nest that enumerates the addresses, which are points in the lattice generated by the basis vectors. The basis determination and lattice enumeration algorithms are linear time algorithms. For the two-level mapping (non-unit alignment stride) problem, we present a fast novel solution that incurs zero memory wastage and little overhead, and relies on two applications of the solution of the one-level mapping problem followed by a fix-up phase. Experimental results demonstrate that our solutions to the address generation problem are significantly faster than other solutions to this problem. In addition, we present a brief overview of our work on related problems such as communication generation, basis vector derivation, code generation for complex subscripts and array redistribution.", "authors": ["J.

{"abstract": "In traditional Software Engineering approaches, an application is described as a composite entity containing all its components. This approach is no longer relevant in modern Software Engineering, at least when developing service-based applications where some components (services) are selected very late during the development process or even \"discovered\" at execution. This new context requires describing an application in a more flexible way, leaving room for delayed selection. In turn, if component selection can be performed all along the life-cycle, an application description must explicitly include the application requirements and goals and the system must at least ensure that the selections satisfy the application description. In this work, we propose a concept of composite addressing the needs of the advanced and flexible service-based applications, automating component selection and building composites satisfying the application description and enforcing minimality, completeness and consistency properties. We also propose tools and environment supporting these concepts and mechanisms in the different phases of the application life-cycle.", "authors": ["Jacky Estublier", "Idrissa Abdoulaye Dieng", "Eric Simon", "Germ\u00e1n Vega"], "n_citation": 7, "title": "Flexible composites and automatic component selection for service-based applications", "venue": "", "year": 2009, "id": "7b3e524c-0eb4-419c-929f-91b9129d3493"}

Six strategies for sample selection are compared on a robot locomotion task. It is found that strategies that select samples that show high fitness in simulation greatly outperform those that do not. One such strategy, which selects the sample that is the expected fittest as well as the most informative (in the sense of producing the most disagreement between potential simulators), results in the creation of a nearly optimal simulator in the first iteration of the simulator tuning algorithm.", "authors": ["Gordon Klaus", "Kyrre Glette", "Jim Torresen"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["03f58eef-d92d-4fce-9eea-8d6b48c5ec8c", "10e4dbef-f559-4543-9a8d-5e6fd8943ba1", "151620ff-d601-4cc2-95dd-d53a841614a7", "1c7397f5-81d6-4b98-a722-9f909340c85d", "3b30f002-49e8-4915-b2a2-57f8a077ba5e", "71ca21c3-305e-4e92-b132-206c8196249c", "93f9c791-c662-4d7e-ac3d-38e7b31a7a28", "97c943d8-1bae-45fc-8f1d-cc295ace5892", "a29f0676-6ccf-44b5-b8d0-2b723e8bded5", "aedcfb7a-fc14-463e-9d02-cebf048fe656", "d3ed7326-ad03-412b-ae6e-ec60fbfe9c62", "e339666b-cc2f-41af-acbb-4afe504e48fc", "e770dade-d44e-496e-8d81-bfc80d04eb59"], "title": "A comparison of sampling strategies for parameter estimation of a robot simulator", "venue": "simulation modeling and programming for autonomous robots", "year": 2012, "id": "7c4ff1fb-b87d-4898-b840-2912fd2bf0d0"}

{"abstract": "Run-time reconfiguration (RTR) of FPGAs is mainly done using the configuration interface. However, for a certain group of designs, RTR using the shift register functionality of the LUTs is a much faster alternative than conventional RTR using the ICAP. This method requires the creation of reconfiguration chains connecting the run-time reconfigurable LUTs (SRL). In this paper, we develop and evaluate a method to generate these reconfiguration chains in an automated way so that their influence on the RTR design is minimised and the reconfiguration time is optimised. We do this by solving a constrained multiple travelling salesman problem (mTSP) based on the placement information of the run-time reconfigurable LUTs. An algorithm based on simulated annealing was developed to solve this new constrained mTSP. We show that using the proposed method, reconfiguration chains can be added with minimal influence on the clock frequency of the original design.", "authors": ["Karel Heyse", "Brahim Al Farisi", "Karel Bruneel", "Dirk Stroobandt"], "n_citation": 6, "references": ["1a230583-75e9-4d6b-a047-68d8c11ebc96", "4384197a-96c0-45d6-9842-5c6f0b9bdf57", "8b7a1ed9-d7d6-422e-a568-463e647a0eee", "a59da403-6cb2-4944-8c96-e971877397ff"], "title": "Automating reconfiguration chain generation for SRL-Based run-time reconfiguration", "venue": "applied reconfigurable computing", "year": 2012, "id": "7c786e2a-306e-4db7-a5ae-4991b163c111"}
{"abstract": "The discovery of DNA has been one of the biggest catalysts in genomic research. Sequencing has enabled us to access the wealth of information encoded in DNA and has provided the basis for ground-breaking achievements such as the first complete human genome sequence. Furthermore, it has tremendously advanced our understanding of life-threatening genetic disorders and bacterial and viral infections. With the recent advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, sequencing became accessible to the majority of researchers and made metagenomic sequencing widely available. However, to realise its true potential, sophisticated and tailor-made bioinformatic programs are essential to translate the collected data into meaningful information.#R##N##R##N#My thesis explored the potential of resolving fine-scale variation in NGS data. The identification and correction of artificial fine-scale variation in the form of biases and errors is imperative in order to draw valid conclusions. Furthermore, resolving natural fine-scale variation in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and closely related species or strains is critical for the development of effective treatments and the characterisation of diseases. In recent years, Illumina has emerged as the global market leader in DNA sequencing. However, biases and errors associated with this high-throughput sequencing technology are still poorly understood which has precluded the development of effective noise removal algorithms. In addition, many programs were not designed for Illumina data or metagenomic sequencing. Therefore, a better understanding of the idiosyncrasies encountered in Illumina data is essential and programs must be tested and benchmarked on realistic and reliable in silico data sets to reveal not only their true capacities but also their limitations.#R##N##R##N#I conducted the largest in vivo study of Illumina error profiles in combination with state-of-the-art library preparation methods to date. For the first time, a direct connection between experimental design factors and systematic errors was established, providing detailed insight into the nature of Illumina errors. Further, I tested various error removal techniques and developed a sophisticated Illumina amplicon noise removal algorithm, enabling researchers to choose optimal processing strategies for their particular data sets. In addition, I devised several simulation tools that accurately reflect artificial and natural fine-scale variation. This includes a flexible and efficient read simulation program which is the only program that can directly reflect the impact of experimental design factors. Furthermore, I developed a program simulating the evolution of a virus into a quasi-species. These programs formed the basis for two comprehensive benchmarking studies that revealed the capacities and limitations of viral haplotype reconstruction programs and taxonomic classification programs, respectively. My work furthers our knowledge of Illumina sequencing errors and will facilitate more accurate and effective analyses of sequencing data sets.", "authors": ["Melanie Schirmer"], "n_citation": 0, "title": "Algorithms for viral haplotype reconstruction and bacterial metagenomics: resolving fine-scale variation in next generation sequencing data", "venue": "", "year": 2014, "id": "7c82c1b3-0ec5-48a6-bf1c-033e34960bb2"}

{"abstract": "Accessibility is unfortunately not among the main concern when developing web sites. Webmasters create mostly involuntarily numerous obstacles for people with visual impairments. That's why it becomes fundamental to identify the existing barriers and to propose solutions in order to at least diminish their impact to the user. Accessibility guidelines, as WCAG 2.0, indicate that a minimum difference of brightness, tonality and contrast is necessary to reach a minimum level of accessibility. In numerous cases, web designers ignore or just limit their choices to a low level of accessibility. For an user needing a higher level of accessibility than the one offered by the web page, the access to information may be difficult. In this context, we propose to transform the colors of web pages according to user's needs with the help of a client-side HTTP proxy. The requirements for the colors can be expressed as a fitness function. In order to recolor the page to increase accessibility, it's enough to minimize the fitness function.#R##N##R##N#Trying to find a minimum can be a time consuming task not appropriate for real time recoloring. Finding a minimum can be considered as a search with varying time limits.

Multiplication by 3/2 is conjectured to even have an orbit of 0-finite configurations that is dense in the usual product topology. An open problem by K. Mahler about Z-numbers has a natural interpretation in terms the automaton F\u00d73/2. We also remark that the automaton F\u00d73 that multiplies by 3 can be slightly modified to simulate the Collatz function.

{"abstract": "Current top-N recommendation methods compute the rec- ommendations by taking into account only relations between pairs of items, thus leading to potential unused information when higher-order re- lations between the items exist. Past attempts to incorporate the higher-order information were done in the context of neighborhood-based methods. However, in many datasets, they did not lead to significant improvements in the recommendation quality. We developed a top-N recommendation method that revisits the issue of higher-order relations, in the context of the model-based Sparse LInear Method (SLIM). The approach followed (Higher-Order Sparse LInear Method, or HOSLIM) learns two sparse aggregation coefficient matrices S and S that cap- ture the item-item and itemset-item similarities, respectively. Matrix S allows HOSLIM to capture higher-order relations, whose complexity is determined by the length of the itemset. Following the spirit of SLIM, matrices S and S are estimated using an elastic net formulation, which promotes model sparsity. We conducted extensive experiments which show that higher-order interactions exist in real datasets and when in- corporated in the HOSLIM framework, the recommendations made are improved. The experimental results show that the greater the presence of higher-order relations, the more substantial the improvement in rec- ommendation quality is, over the best existing methods. In addition, our experiments show that the performance of HOSLIM remains good when we select S such that its number of nonzeros is comparable toS ,w hich reduces the time required to compute the recommendations.", "authors": ["Evangelia Christakopoulou", "George Karypis"], "n_citation": 16, "references": ["1fe699bc-6db9-45b9-a769-e951d1d2bc60", "2c7dad08-ec10-4717-8f55-1d310cb7ca2b", "2e6abbcc-e5f7-4d66-8d19-d74f1e7f9cc7", "5f6f5fb3-b316-4722-9a53-2ff9dbf378d1", "7482cc04-8a43-4494-b41a-e6e42259b30f", "9b602954-f960-46fe-87ae-41f06c486efc", "b88af369-cc19-446a-b944-7a9955ec6f0e", "ed4c0d5d-5152-4915-b9bd-d0bd25f82674", "feddae21-3c05-4743-80fa-b8e101f1b93f"], "title": "HOSLIM: Higher-Order Sparse LInear Method for Top-N Recommender Systems", "venue": "pacific-asia conference on knowledge discovery and data mining", "year": 2014, "id": "7e631247-8145-41aa-a39c-839229028e24"}

{"abstract": "Structural variation in genomes can be revealed by many (dis)similarity measures. Rearrangement operations, such as the so called double-cut-and-join (DCJ), are large-scale mutations that can create complex changes and produce such variations in genomes. A basic task in comparative genomics is to find the rearrangement distance between two given genomes, i.e., the minimum number of rearragement operations that transform one given genome into another one. In a family-based setting, genes are grouped into gene families and efficient algorithms were already proposed to compute the DCJ distance between two given genomes. In this work we propose the problem of computing the DCJ distance of two given genomes without prior gene family assignment, di- rectly using the pairwise similarity between genes. We propose a new family-free DCJ distance, prove that the family-free DCJ distance prob- lem is APX-hard, and provide an integer linear program to its solution.", "authors": ["F\u00e1bio Viduani Martinez", "Pedro Feij\u00e3o", "Mar\u00edlia D.

{"abstract": "Benchmarks have historically played a key role in guiding the progress of computer science systems research and development, but have traditionally neglected the areas of availability, maintainability, and evolutionary growth, areas that have recently become critically important in high-end system design. As a first step in addressing this deficiency, we introduce a general methodology for benchmarking the availability of computer systems. Our methodology uses fault injection to provoke situations where availability may be compromised, leverages existing performance benchmarks for workload generation and data collection, and can produce results in both detail-rich graphical presentations or in distilled numerical summaries. We apply the methodology to measure the availability of the software RAID systems shipped with Linux, Solaris 7 Server, and Windows 2000 Server, and find that the methodology is powerful enough not only to quantify the impact of various failure conditions on the availability of these systems, but also to unearth their design philosophies with respect to transient errors and recovery policy.", "authors": ["Aaron B.

{"abstract": "We present two variants of OMD which are robust against nonce misuse. Security of OMD---a CAESAR candidate---relies on the assumption that implementations always ensure correct use of nonce (a.k.a. message number); namely that, the nonce never gets repeated. However, in some application environments, this non-repetitiveness requirement on nonce might be compromised or ignored, yielding to full collapse of the security guaranty. We aim to reach maximal possible level of robustness against repeated nonces, as defined by Rogaway and Shrimpton (FSE 2006) under the name misuse-resistant AE (MRAE). Our first scheme, called misuse-resistant OMD (MR-OMD), is designed to be substantially similar to OMD while achieving stronger security goals; hence, being able to reuse any existing common code/hardware. Our second scheme, called parallelizable misuse-resistant OMD (PMR-OMD), further deviates from the original OMD design in its encryption process, providing a parallelizable algorithm, in contrast with OMD and MR-OMD which have serial encryption/decryption processes. Both MR-OMD and PMR-OMD are single-key mode of operation. It is known that maximally robust MRAE schemes are necessarily two-pass, a price paid compared to a one-pass scheme such as OMD. Nevertheless, in MR-OMD and PMR-OMD, we combine the two passes in a way that minimizes the incurred additional cost: the overhead incurred by the second pass in our two-pass variants is about 50 % of the encryption time for OMD.", "authors": ["Reza Reyhanitabar", "Serge Vaudenay", "Damian Viz\u00e1r"], "n_citation": 13, "references": ["1dffd2b6-e85d-471b-9c2e-861af2c22529", "309c850f-fb86-4944-9050-4d364982e8ab", "3ecba135-f5ae-474b-a011-03493f10204e", "3f5c0052-9afc-498f-8922-d8a3ee988bcb", "58592fc0-9183-4b07-8198-9f2e84168113", "6b2c332a-143c-437f-8928-22b7b366cd4f", "73353b54-252e-4d06-befb-2c7129883759", "78cabee2-26db-4921-99a8-6e9a79ee2aa0", "7f32bf74-77a7-40ca-b152-62aaff998b91", "8c6d086e-963e-4e6f-9c40-ae077113887c", "8d43ca8e-9529-48b7-a716-c8039cd1d478", "9360bcd0-daa8-42f7-b5a2-43951d67263e", "9f57043a-a878-4bc6-8087-006b725420cb", "bd8d16a8-5cef-4cbc-9d91-d7b9c92c5340", "c6a66880-5abd-46ec-99ac-863d6ab08d1a", "d668cc65-189b-4b6d-9f86-ba974d9e0aa1", "e13b38e7-0d78-4e52-9801-2b943fd7ab59", "ec02085b-a9a6-4d68-aa27-16c75a3e4c75"], "title": "Misuse-Resistant Variants of the OMD Authenticated Encryption Mode", "venue": "provable security", "year": 2014, "id": "7eb3da89-2003-43fd-b013-f371b60e0d6c"}

{"abstract": "A significant challenge in evaluating network security stems from the scale of modern enterprise networks and the vast number of vulnerabilities regularly found in software applications. A common technique to deal with this complexity is attack graphs, where a tool automatically computes all possible ways a system can be broken into by analyzing the configuration of each host, the network, and the discovered vulnerabilities. Past work has proposed methodologies that postprocess \"raw\" attack graphs so that the result can be abstracted and becomes easier for a human user to grasp. We notice that, while visualization is a major problem caused by the multitude of attack paths in an attack graph, a more severe problem is the distorted risk picture it renders to both human users and quantitative vulnerability assessment models. We propose that abstraction be done before attack graphs are computed, instead of after. This way we can prevent the distortion in quantitative vulnerability assessment metrics, at the same time improving visualization as well. We developed an abstract network model generator that, given reachability and configuration information of a network, provides an abstracted model with much more succinct information about the system than the raw model. The model is generated by grouping hosts based on their network reachability and vulnerability information, as well as grouping vulnerabilities with similar exploitability. We show that the attack graphs generated from this type of abstracted inputs are not only much smaller, but also provide more realistic quantitative vulnerability metrics for the whole system. We conducted experiments on both synthesized and production systems to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "authors": ["Su Zhang", "Xinming Ou", "John Homer"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["03978e19-79d6-46cf-9cd6-103a819ed7ea", "0ed4fbb6-2714-4eec-b3cf-6a74389e659e", "2302db0b-2912-4fe7-9001-24bf906b0667", "331f95b3-9488-4316-ae28-4b23aff76001", "36cfbe0a-36d4-4f1b-9288-0c719e2f074f", "387ef070-e8f8-42f7-b2d9-5d973d2ba694", "577b8b2c-0f1e-41ce-af78-6d078b9403cb", "6592be96-4a3a-4d14-889a-95b09e682d13", "80eb722d-3232-475e-9d94-9c3b6259de24", "86dcf0a4-f5ad-4c0c-90c0-def47610a9a7", "90f2054e-fce2-4e38-bbc5-2fd3deef5155", "9885d407-ddbb-4dd1-b266-7fac30e358d9", "9f8cc1db-a40b-493c-8bb6-5d492ea5d614", "afa7bb9d-aca2-4190-a100-481ede5fca63", "b2f6aa68-e486-487e-a41f-5eda27c57ebb", "d89f44b3-e0d2-4813-8408-c83027951acb", "da879e66-aa38-4307-b1ad-9d13ee632d2d", "dbfb64f3-b361-4d7d-922a-f5201f17b35e", "e8e17deb-02dc-4ee8-bc7a-7bf214faec3e", "eb92e933-2af2-422b-a384-2fb87403aeb1", "f861806d-0ff7-4568-868d-136a90efbdd7", "f86a50e6-ff95-444e-9b85-0cf5ce2da5cb", "fe527727-e91b-435b-a680-c31df10bc977"], "title": "Effective network vulnerability assessment through model abstraction", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "id": "7f0a0370-f42d-4d65-94e2-278fa8673c52"}

One way to increase the performance of these algorithms and applications is by using the computing power of Graphics Processing Units (GPU).

In this paper, we investigate ways of improving execution performance of multi-agent systems (MAS) models by means of relevant task allocation mechanisms, which are suitable for GPU execution. Several task allocation architecture variants for MAS using GPU are identified and their properties analyzed.

Our aim is to capture the navigational behaviour of existing users (as recorded in the click logs) so that we can assist future users by proposing the most relevant pages as they navigate the site without changing the actual Web site and do this adaptively so that a continuous learning cycle is being employed. In this paper we explore three different algorithms that can be employed to learn such suggestions from navigation logs.

{"abstract": "We consider the problem of determining which of a set of experts has tastes most similar to a given user by asking the user questions about his likes and dislikes. We describe a simple algorithm for generating queries for a theoretical model of this problem. We show that the algorithm requires at most opt(F)(ln(vFv/opt(F)) + 1) + 1 queries to find the correct expert, where opt(F) is the optimal worst-case bound on the number of queries for learning arbitrary elements of the set of experts F. The algorithm runs in time polynomial in vFv and vXv (where X is the domain) and we prove that no polynomial-time algorithm can have a significantly better bound on the number of queries unless all problems in NP have nO(log log n) time algorithms. We also study a more general case where the user ratings come from a finite set Y and there is an integer-valued loss function e on Y that is used to measure the distance between the ratings. Assuming that the loss function is a metric and that there is an expert within a distance \u03b7 from the user, we give a polynomial-time algorithm that is guaranteed to find such an expert after at most 2opt(F, \u03b7) ln \\frac{|F|}{1+\\newdeg(F,\\eta)} + 2(\u03b7 + 1)(1 + deg(F, \u03b7)) queries, where deg(F, \u03b7) is the largest number of experts in F that are within a distance 2\u03b7 of any f \u2208 F.", "authors": ["Sanjoy Dasgupta", "Wee Sun Lee", "Philip M.

{"abstract": "Legal texts consist of a great variety of texts, for example laws, rules, statutes, etc. This kind of documents has as an important feature, that they are strongly linked among them, since they include references from one part to another. This makes it difficult to consult them, because in order to satisfy an information request, it is necessary to gather several references and rulings from a single text, and even with other texts. The goal of this work is to help in the process of consulting legal rulings through their retrieval from a request expressed as a question in natural language. For this, a formal model is proposed; this model is based on a weighted, non-directed graph; nodes represent the articles that integrate each document, and its edges represent references between articles and their degree of similarity. Given a question, this is added to the graph, and by combining a shortest-path algorithm with edge weight analysis, a ranked list of articles is obtained. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model we gathered 8,987 rulings and evaluated the answer to 40 test-questions as correct, incorrect or partial. A lawyer validated the answer to these questions.

{"abstract": "Previous research in computational aesthetics has led to the identification of multiple image features that, in combination, can be related to the aesthetic quality of images, such as photographs. Moreover, it has been shown that aesthetic artworks possess specific higher-order statistical properties, such as a scale-invariant Fourier spectrum, that can be linked to coding mechanisms in the human visual system. In the present work, we derive novel measures based on a PHOG representation of images for image properties that have been studied in the context of the aesthetic assessment of images previously. We demonstrate that a large dataset of colored aesthetic paintings of Western provenance is characterized by a specific combination of the PHOG-derived aesthetic measures (high self-similarity, moderate complexity and low anisotropy). In this combination, the artworks differ significantly from seven other datasets of photographs that depict various types of natural and man-made scenes, patterns and objects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that these features have been derived and evaluated on a large dataset of different image categories.", "authors": ["Christoph Redies", "Seyed Ali Amirshahi", "Michael R.

{"abstract": "In this paper we present a case study of early prototyping work performed within a Danish advanced technology project. We specifically investigate the problems and issues related to throw-away prototypes in sensor-intensive systems. An important criterion is to record and perhaps later reproduce the identified contributions of the throw-away prototypes, and to this end we use the educational version of Lego Mindstorms NXT. To achieve methodological rigor we have used the Design Science Framework by Hevner et. al. It allows us to focus on the prototyping effort (called the design cycle) without letting go of either the relevance or rigor related to the project. We relate the case study to a Human Work Interaction Design (HWID) framework for the use of interactive, sensor-intensive prototypes to develop interactive greenhouse climate management systems. By applying guidelines suggested in design science to the case studied, we identify a number of interactive prototypes that successively address core issues in this particular setting. Finally, the problems and issues pertaining to this setting is presented and identified. The main contribution of this paper is that it, by pointing out problems and issues related throw-away prototyping with sensor-intensive systems, extends the design cycle of the original design science framework. This is determined to be a necessary step in order to address the inherent multi-disciplinarily of sensor-intensive HWID systems.", "authors": ["Rasmus Ulslev Pedersen", "Torkil Clemmensen"], "n_citation": 2, "references": ["01a37d6d-1fa2-4271-9e93-defeea0b5b64", "1d3a176d-f23e-4e46-b6a3-91befab7e33f", "231499a2-777a-4223-80dc-7ab0b9af7dd4", "2c91f1d8-286e-46de-ae81-ade1edbf03bd", "32772998-6b13-43eb-8121-d61edd54c509", "3483b95e-6468-4b64-918d-3a8df43d0478", "3dffb3ad-079d-44c0-9201-37c3066f5b45", "69117af8-468a-49e7-8bdd-98187346b974", "885cfaf9-43e5-4101-9554-40962d09fe53", "8df0a953-0054-437a-bc95-daab2f8b4cba", "91821ac5-0879-4ee3-a271-5a082fe1645d", "92238f37-5863-4c44-8a7b-19aac00f2083", "c5aeaabe-0656-42db-a6fc-15930ef98ef7", "c5c67b24-3488-4e7f-a8ac-48c379544239", "c86509e3-f057-4144-b5d0-db4e8090cdfe", "fe139066-d1ce-467b-b038-b21ea9c8f97e"], "title": "A Design Science Approach to Interactive Greenhouse Climate Control Using Lego Mindstorms for Sensor-Intensive Prototyping", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "id": "80cd7b06-9bbb-4e23-b2a1-3375c6428491"}

En nuestra propuesta, el Modelo Independiente de la Plataforma (PIM, Platform Independent Model) sera el modelo conceptual de datos y a partir de este obtendremos el Modelo Especifico de Plataforma (PSM, Platform Specific Model), esto es el modelo OR. Dado que la notacion utilizada en ambos modelos es UML, la propuesta incluye tambien los correspondientes perfiles UML para la elaboracion del modelo OR (para el estandar SQL:2003 y para un producto concreto, Oracle10g). Este articulo se centra en la formalizacion de los mappings de PIM a PSM.

{"abstract": "In virtual machine environments, it is difficult to allocate CPU resource to virtual machine efficiently because virtual machine lacks knowledge of each domains workload. Especially, realtime tasks in guest domain have to finish before their deadline, however, virtual machine scheduler is not aware of guest-level tasks and how much resources guest domain requires. In this paper, we present a virtual machine scheduling framework based on feedback mechanism. The proposed mechanism ex- ploits various scheduling information from each domain. Xen scheduler controls the CPU allocation by increasing or decreasing CPU slices. We evaluate our prototype in terms of realtime task performance over diverse workload. Our experiment result shows that feedback mechanism effec- tively allocates CPU resources for guest domain in varying workloads.", "authors": ["Byung Ki Kim", "Kyung Woo Hur", "Jae Hyuck Jang", "Young Woong Ko"], "n_citation": 8, "references": ["34ee654a-e976-471f-b77b-ff4d7178dab9", "42272aea-20bf-4d71-9294-c79bf4f34abe", "581c327c-a55c-4fd6-9978-09c0a3f8e5f1", "78991392-db9c-45a4-86a2-b4ce93ab0ec0", "9184dc77-23ac-45cb-864b-7a4211f888bd", "aaec1b04-6e63-4f17-933c-680398a89ed1", "f93faab6-fade-4014-9454-78e85d8b0d2b"], "title": "Feedback Scheduling for Realtime Task on Xen Virtual Machine", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "id": "81c392f5-8450-4a93-94e3-0d5e06830ad6"}

{"abstract": "In this paper we present a prefetch technique, which incorporates a scheme similar to data streaming to minimize the response-lag. Unlike previous all or none techniques, we propose partial prefetch where the size of the lead segment is computed optimally so that only a minimum but sufficient amount of data is prefetched and buffered. The remaining segment is fetched if and only when the media is traversed. Thus, it delivers content without any increase in perceived response delay, and at the same time drastically minimizes unnecessary pre-load. The paper presents the scheme in the context of surfing in composite multimedia documents. It presents the technique and optimization scheme used for stream segmentation backed by analytical model and statistical simulation.

To match the ideal system response characteristics, this improved variant of Differential Evolution technique is employed to optimize the values of the filter bank coefficients. The filter response is optimized in both pass band and stop band. The overall filter bank response consists of objective functions termed as reconstruction error, mean square error in pass band and mean square error in stop band. Effective designing can be performed if the objective function is properly minimized. The proposed algorithm can perform much better than the other existing design methods.

{"abstract": "The amount of data that is available as Linked Data on the Web has grown rapidly over the last years. However, the linkage between data sources remains sparse as setting RDF links means effort for the data publishers. Many existing methods for generating these links rely on explicit linkage rules which specify the conditions which must hold true for two entities in order to be interlinked. As writing good linkage rules by hand is a non-trivial problem, the burden to generate links between data sources is still high. In order to reduce the effort and required expertise to write linkage rules, we present an approach which combines genetic programming and active learning for the interactive generation of expressive linkage rules. Our approach automates the generation of a linkage rule and only requires the user to confirm or decline a number of example links. The algorithm minimizes user involvement by selecting example links which yield a high information gain. The proposed approach has been implemented in the Silk Link Discovery Framework. Within our experiments, the algorithm was capable of finding linkage rules with a full F1-measure by asking the user to confirm or decline a maximum amount of 20 links.", "authors": ["Robert Isele", "Anja Jentzsch", "Christian Bizer"], "n_citation": 16, "references": ["247c72b9-dfce-4fdd-a465-44c45815a24f", "3ee77973-62eb-4480-9b97-893e5e463994", "4edfe15d-43c9-4db2-a4c7-c527773538c4", "4f31a8c6-683a-4f36-9dd5-1cee97e261b9", "59a14fa0-9568-40ff-8c8b-b6bd4614713d", "aea51177-d0ab-4381-afe3-8ba09b071c5b", "e9d467f0-f473-4301-9d97-a17a7ced4504"], "title": "Active learning of expressive linkage rules for the web of data", "venue": "international conference on web engineering", "year": 2012, "id": "826f408f-6c1a-4a80-b593-79f0f9127521"}
